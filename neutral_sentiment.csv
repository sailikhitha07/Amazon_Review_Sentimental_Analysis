"This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again.",Neutral
"The flavors are good.  However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy.",Neutral
This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores.  There is nothing healthy about it.  It is just carbs and sugars.  Save your money and get something that at least has some taste.,Neutral
we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy.  doubt very much habanero is used at all.  could take it up a notch or two.,Neutral
"Watch your prices with this.  While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was<br />$3-4 less at Target.",Neutral
"If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok. Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints. But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp. when you add on the shipping).",Neutral
"The taste was great, but the berries had melted.  May order again in winter. If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavor.",Neutral
"While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice. I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help. The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again. I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients.",Neutral
"Awesome dog food. However, when given to my ""Boston"", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching. As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped. So glad Natural Balance has other choices. I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet.",Neutral
not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products,Neutral
"I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours! Not sure if that is healthy or not .... and you can buy this at Walmart for $0.28, way cheaper than Amazon.",Neutral
"I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.",Neutral
These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon. They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product. But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from.,Neutral
"I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace. The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me.",Neutral
"The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smaller. Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great. The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope.",Neutral
"WE have been looking for ""natural"" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.",Neutral
"The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright.  Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again.  There is just a slight ""vitaminy"" taste, but it's not overwhelming.  It's also a bit pricey for what you get.",Neutral
"Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE!!! LOLOLOL!!!",Neutral
"My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more.",Neutral
The pork chops from Omaha Steaks were very tasty but at the same time exceptionally dry. Pork is usually dry meat but these were to the extreme. Possibly shipping them frozen and keeping them frozen was partly the problem.,Neutral
"I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years, after being introduced to it in a Starbucks. My most recent purchase, however, was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a ""1"" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a ""51A""). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw.",Neutral
"I thought this was a great buy, but as noted by Scott D., the molasses content was not up to par.  I loved the higher molasses content ""Sugar in the Raw"".  Unfortunately what I purchased recently does not have the higher molasses content and I have twelve 24 ounce bags.  I guess I'll watch for the next crop.",Neutral
"howdy y'all,<br /><br />the actual product is VERY good - i'd rate the item a 4 on it's own. however, it's only ONE dollar at the local grocery and - @ twenty eight+ dollars per twelve pack - these are running almost two and a half dollars each.<br /><br />as i said, TOO EXPENSIVE. [*sigh ...*] i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local cost.<br /><br />take care,<br />lee",Neutral
"Nothing wrong with the product, but I sure had to mix it with *lots* of other ingredients to make it edible to me. (In Texas I was called a ""baby-mouth"" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)<br /><br />For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though.",Neutral
"I am a energy junkie and I'm not sure if this works or not, but what I do know is that the taste is not the greatest. I do drink the steaz energy drink and I think I get the same results. I like this products because it is  more natural then the others.",Neutral
"I purchased it because it was on sale. In terms of the energy it provides, it works, but the taste leaves something to be desired. I tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable.",Neutral
"I was amazed at how quickly it arrived!  It is a cute stocking stuffer, but only OK as far as user appeal.  You get what you pay for.",Neutral
Toy was typical quality I expected.  I got taken for a major ride on the shipping!,Neutral
This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned.  I couldn't get the food pieces out to save my life. I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests.,Neutral
"I love, love, love the idea of this product and my little one loves, loves, loves to use it.  She gets fresh fruit and other tasty things and I don't have to worry about her choking.  The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags.",Neutral
"The Munchkin fresh food feeder is an okay product, it's kind of like sucking on food through a cloth. While my daughter was interested in it for a little while, she eventually lost interest. I may introduce it back to her again and see how she reacts.",Neutral
"The spicy version of this ketchup isn't bad, but it is too expensive.  The regular version is sweet as dessert.  Horrible.  Annie's Organic has a much better flavor and costs a lot less.  Even Heinz organic is a better deal.  I gave it three stars instead of two because it is in glass, not plastic.",Neutral
I love the flour however Amazon sent it with a book which broke a bag and made a mess. Customer sevice took care of the problem however it was a foolish way to ship the product.,Neutral
"Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this... I'm not a fancy cheese eater), and it lingers for at least an hour. I'd give this flavor a rating of 2 stars out of 5.<br /><br />We have also tried the NY Cheddar flavor (4 stars), which we both liked better, and they didn't leave any long-lingering or bad aftertaste.<br /><br />I'd give the consistency of the chips 4 stars. The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.",Neutral
"I usually love Kettle Chips, and love salt & vinegar, but these chips were way too vinegary for me! They do have the typical kettle chip crunch, but are too aggressively flavored for my taste.",Neutral
"OK,I did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful. I took the plunge as I do like salty, and tangy flavors. No, I had never had these before I took the leap and ordered a case at a super price. They arrived quickly and in great shape with the sell by date  FEB 2011. Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)",Neutral
"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.",Neutral
This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.  Make sure you like salt & vinegar before ordering. You may be in for a suprise if you have never tried them before.  I'll stick with the salt and black pepper chips.,Neutral
"These are decent, but if you want a realllly good salt and vinegar chip, try Boulder's Salt and Malt Vinegar chips.  THOSE are awesome.",Neutral
"These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these. Otherwise, you will overdose on their cheddary goodness.",Neutral
These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy. Had to keep wiping my fingers on a napkin.,Neutral
"The first time I tried these, I thought, ""WOW!"" but I quickly found they were just too darn spicy and tart... Hard to enjoy the potato-chippiness of them when your mouth is under seige.",Neutral
"These chips are okay.  Personally, I find the flavor combination on a greasy chip to be somewhat strange.  They're not necessarily bad but they're the kind of chip where you're only going to be able to have three of four chips before the flavor loses its novelty.",Neutral
These are better in England. I don't know why. Maybe it's just nostalgia on my part.,Neutral
"I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.99/case, I put my order without doubt.  However, when I received the case, I found out that the whole case is expiring in December while I got it at the end of August.  I tried one package and I can definitely taste the unfreshness in the chips.  I was disappointed and then I found out this item is not returnable!  How convenient!  Although I love this chips, I won't order from here again with the concern of close expiration date...",Neutral
I dont know if they were fresh or if they were supposed to taste like they did. I checked the expiration date it was current but still tasted kind of stale to me !!!,Neutral
"These chips are tasty but not what I expected from a ""low salt"" item.  They seem as salty as any ""regular"" potato chip, and they also seem excessively greasy.  By comparison, Cape Cod Reduced Fat chips are less salty with at least as much potato flavor and far less greasy.",Neutral
"Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes ""too much"". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are ""Krinkle Cut"" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.",Neutral
Miss Vickies are better but unfortunately less widely available.  I'm not sure tough is the right word but there is a noticeable difference between the two brands and Miss Vickie's are better IMHO.,Neutral
"I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.",Neutral
"These were not flavorful enough for my taste. It seems that all the seasoning falls off the chips and sinks to the bottom of the bag. Too bad, because I really liked the idea of a healthier potato chip. I would not buy these again.",Neutral
"Expiration date 1-13. Smashed and. stale. edible, not real enjoyable for the price I paid, One of the best pretzel's I had when<br />i purchased them from Publix. They stopped carrying them, I must find another addiction.",Neutral
"This product is made by Annie's Inc. in Berkely, CA--made in the USA.  The product maintains excellent organic integrity, and it is stored in 100% recycled paperboard packaging.<br /><br />The manufacturers also support family farms - use organic milk, butter, and yogurt.  The product takes approximately 10 min. to prepare.  The product contains dairy and wheat, and it has been exposed to equipment that also processes egg and soy products.<br /><br />The ingredients include organic whole wheat shell pasta, organic valley organic cheddar cheese (organic cultured pasteurized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), organic whey, salt, and sodium phosphate.<br /><br />This is a mildly flavored whole wheat macaroni & cheese dinner.  This mac and cheese is a wonderful comfort food.  The pasta is firm, and it has an excellent flavor.<br /><br />There are no artificial flavors, synthetics colors, or preservatives.  The pasta was produced without antibiotics, synthetic hormones, or persistent pesticides.<br /><br />This pasta is simple to make and it has a wonderful texture.  There are 2.5 servings per box (2.5 oz).  Each serving contains 250 cal., 4.5 g fat, sat. 2 g fat, 10 mg cholest., 570 mg sodium, 43 g carb., 5 g fiber, 6 g sugars, 9 g protein.<br /><br />However, the cheese envelop is not exactly sufficient even when you add the butter, milk, or yogurt.  To add that wonderful rich smooth cheese flavor that accompanies mac and cheese, you will have to add your own organic cheese.<br /><br />The cheese packet falls flat on flavor and it does not contain a sufficient amount to coat the pasta.  I give this mac and cheese a 5/5 on packaging, 5/5 for maintain organic integrity, 5/5 on texture, and a 2/5 for flavor.",Neutral
"This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this ""Kona coffee"" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.",Neutral
Bought this at a local specialty-item store because I adore chutney.  Because of the higher price and being sold like a gourmet item I wrongly thought it would be better than the affordable brands sold at the supermarket.  Wrong.  It is mostly gel (jelly) with a few fruits sprinkled throughout and tastes like cheap thickened jelly you put on sandwiches...I've had much better and that's just talking about the supermarket brands.  Very disappointed.  Money does not buy quality.,Neutral
I was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken. I couldn't send it back as i needed for a project.,Neutral
"Of course, we all know how delicious Ghirardelli chocolate is!!!! Unfortunately, after I purchased two of these gift bags online, I found them in a local store for half the price. Lesson learned???!!!",Neutral
Are people really paying 10 bucks for these chocolates??? ummmm go to any grocery store and by them for 2.98 a bag..wow,Neutral
"This was really a disappointment. While the products included are fine, the real disappointment was the travel mug. It is a cheap plastic cup with the nutritional information for the cookies on it! So it is basically just a cookie package! Yeah, that is really what I want to use as a travel mug. I agree with the review that it looks like it came from a dollar store. The product description says the polka dot tumbler is ""definitely a keeper."" What? It is simply cheap packaging! Not something of quality to enjoy. Had I known that I would not have purchased the set. I really was looking forward to using the cute looking mug on a daily basis. I like the products inside and the basket is OK, but really this what not what it appeared to be.",Neutral
"It looks pretty, but the contents are very minute and seem to not be of very high quality. There's a plastic cup for the tea that looks like it came from a dollar store. The basket is nice, though.",Neutral
"Besides that mentioned in the title, the only other remarks I have about it is the price is hard to beat, the taste is akin to a Flintstone strawberry vitamin (for those of you that have tasted them), and taste lasts for not very long.  I'd say, on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 lasting an extraordinary amount of time this would be a 3.  Also, the taste really diminishes to a subdued sweet after a very short amount of time.",Neutral
"The taste is harsh as it is a lesser grade of Yunnan. It is ok to drink, but not to really enjoy. I only make it for when I am in the hurry and will not be able to fully enjoy my tea anyway.",Neutral
"To my mind, a fine caramel should be creamy and melting.  These are grainy.  The flavor on these was fine, although a little sweet to my taste.",Neutral
"If you are concerned with an aluminum free product, then this is the product for you.  Too bad that baking SODA does not in any form contain aluminum.  This is, however a concern for baking POWDER which can, depending on manufacturer, contain aluminum.  Save your hard earned money and buy Bob's Red Mill regular baking soda.  Arm & Hammer is great for general cleaning purposes, but for natural beauty and health care, this brand is perfect.<br /><br />Just thought you'd all like to know. I almost fell for it myself until I did a little digging around. :)<br /><br />P.S- So as not to let all of amazon.com-land feel I am one of those ""haters who don't really know what they're talking about"", I LOVE Bob's Red Mill Co. and shall continue purchasing their excellent products.",Neutral
The chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother. The product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting Japan.,Neutral
"They are OK, but my husband only eats them when we are in car. We keep them there for a celiac snack. (Hard to find when roaming around.) He won't eat them otherwise. They are definitely raspberry, but are kind of dry.<br />  We have never tried any other snack bars, so in all honesty they may be the norm. I don't know.<br />  We DO like Enjoy Life's other products.<br />  They are GF, have no MSG or related products or aspartates.",Neutral
"Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.  I'm glad they are eating something green because we couldn't get them to eat the one with peas when we tried at 7 months, but we got them to eat the peas later at 9 months.<br /><br />Their favorite vegetable is sweet potato and we've also tried sweet potato with cinnamon. They love all the fruit varieties.<br /><br />I'm glad they love this one because lentils and brown rice form a complete protein, although a view of the ingredients shows that lentils is not one of the prime ingredients.<br /><br />This one also has carrots and I've heard all babies like carrots.  I don't know if they would like it without the carrots.  I haven't seen this one - lentils and brown rice - in our local stores, so I'm glad to get it here. Along with some others, we get this one with the subscription.  Of course, with twins one is forced to buy more in bulk and we're so busy that it's great to get these delivered.<br /><br />The packaging is excellent.  I've ordered an unbelievable number of cases of jars of different types and only had one jar arrive broken.<br /><br />Ingredients per label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 10% protein, 100% vitamin A, 4% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm informed that the daily intake percentage is based on an adult.",Neutral
"I liked getting this one for my twin 10-month olds because it has such interesting ingredients, particularly the zucchini and the garbanzo beans.  I like the fact that it's vegetarian yet I believe it has a complete protein since it also has brown rice.  This list of ingredients looks excellent and it's a green color naturally.<br /><br />The babies liked it.  They have liked everything that has carrots.<br /><br />I have the subscription for this one as I really like the ingredients and the fact that I'm giving the babies food that is naturally green.<br /><br />Ingredients per the label: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.<br /><br />This has 70 calories, 8% protein, 40% vitamin A, 10% vitamin C, 2% calcium and 2% iron.

"Earth's Best Turkey Vegetable Dinner hits the spot with apples with turkey. You can add cranberries if you want to take it to the next level.  I just can't find non-sweetened and non-dried cranberries even at the better food stores.<br /><br />Apples, carrots and turkey taste good to my 10-month old growing twin girls.  Babies love carrots since they're sweet to their taste, so that made a great addition.  The whole barley flour absorbs the water to give it an acceptable consistency.<br /><br />The ingredients per the label: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, mechanically separated organic turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />In addition to 12% protein and 50% vitamin A, it has 6% calcium and 4% iron.<br /><br />I'm very pleased my babies like this food and are being introduced to so many foods through Earth's Best.

"We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok. When I tasted this, I made a face because it was so yucky! I added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon. To her credit, my (8 month old) daughter ate some bites, but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other flavors. I like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein.",Neutral

The smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses. Even though the rose content is very minimal I found the smell overwhelming. I did not like that this brand of spices does not have a seal in place and only a loosely screwed on lid. There is no shaker lid either. You open it and it dumps. I am questioning how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor. I hope it is not chemically enhanced. With the lid being loose and not sealed I have doubts about the safety of the product.,Neutral
"I was hoping these were more true caramels, not caramel-flavored truffles, but they're still delicious. Would definitely order them again, and maybe extra for gifts.

For $40 a box, I expect NO CORN SYRUP.

I don't have too much experience with oolongs, but I do like the flavor of this. However, I don't taste too much of the mandarin. It almost tastes sort of like a straight green tea, and it has a similar light green/yellow color. I drink it with a little honey.<br /><br />All in all, it's a decent tea.

"Just in case, if anyone doesn't know what WHITE tea is, as opposed to green or black, let's quote Wikipedia: ""white tea is fast-dried, while green tea is roasted in an oven or pan (while kept moving for even curing). Oolong and black teas are fermented before curing."" What does it mean? For me, it translates into my favorite beverage to start the day with and to keep me going through the day. Objectively and scientifically speaking, white tea is said to have more anti-oxidants and less caffeine so, in my view, it's overall better than coffee or the black or green varieties.<br /><br />This particular product, while it comes in tea bags, it's not exactly your 'supermarket' variety. Unlike the cheap teas, black, green, herbal or white that are delivered crushed inside paper bags, the 'Choice' brand is delivered in pyramid shaped, biodegradable, nylon-like bags that ensure that what you get is actual leaves, not some indistinct crushed powder.<br /><br />This being a white tea, 'delicate' and 'subtle' and the required adjectives to use but they may not apply in this case. I found the added flowers to be a little too strong, bordering to overpowering for my taste. The Lychee and Osmanthus aromas can be an acquired taste - think of sweet, green apples for an equivalent more familiar aroma. If it's not 'love at the first sip', give it some time and you may not only tolerate it but prefer it to other flavors. Or not.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />- organic, fair trade certified White Tea<br />- natural Lychee flavor<br />- organic Osmanthus flavor<br />- contains caffeine<br /><br />The somewhat off-balance added flavors and the premium price are not likely to turn me into a repeat customer.

"After searching for a more constant and less expensive supply of ""real"" licorice over my favorite (more about that later), I decided to try this one based upon other reviews and the description. I have to say that I was disappointed. It is not intense enough and a bit too salty for my preference since all that I noticed was salt and more salt until it got down to the licorice flavor which I would charactize as ""modest"". My all time favorite licorice was discovered years ago while visiting a St. Louis mall has been and remains an excellent choice made by Bissinger's Chocolate Company and they call it French Long Licorice. It is not noticeably salty and packed with flavor without being a sicky-sweet candy. I say that and caution licorice lovers to know their favorite ""type"" of licorice; this is important when reading reviews and purchasing. I was looking for something not American-style junk candy, with actual licorice extract not anise, chewy, lasting, with true strong licorice flavor and no other flavor overtones.<br /><br />As far a Bissinger's is concerned, they do not make this licorice year round nor advertise it on their website or in their catalogs so you have to call their toll free number and ask if it has been in production. It is expensive but well worth it for excellent flavor and lasting ability (I can enjoy one for at least 15 minutes if I don't chew). These are my favorite thing to have when reading a great book and I limit myself to 2 at a sitting for my ""fix""; okay, sometimes 3 if it is a superb book:D.<br />The last time I ordered it they were generous and added a pound of their premium chocolate as a thank-you for being a customer that troubled to find their particular product because I do not live near one of their stores and unless I visit say St. Louis (where it is headquartered) I have to mail-order.Anyway, I prefer my licorice hard and let it soften in my mouth so when I get an order ($56 for 2lbs) I leave it out lightly wrapped for a few days to harden off. That makes it last longer in my mouth and does not affect flavor but that it personal mouth feel preference. It frezes without problems so I will just have to go back to that and pay for my pleasure and stock up :). Licorice-gotta have it!",Neutral

"I have mixed feelings about NuNaturals Nustevia White Stevia with Maltodextrin Powder and will probably not purchase it again.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it's easy to use and tastes great.  If you're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product's mixture.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 5-star taste<br />- Easy to measure<br />- Perfect for first-time stevia users<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 6.4% stevia<br />- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn't try to hide the fact that it's just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).<br /><br />In case you're wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  Pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar.",Neutral

"Are you familiar with the Hormel Compleats line?  If so, put this one in the middle of the pack.  It's not as good as the meatloaf or the meatballs/noodles in cream sauce.  It's better than the horribly taste-free chicken/dressing.  About even with the turkey.  Is that all I've tried?  I forget; but you get the point.  It's medium-Compleat.<br /><br />Are you just thinking about trying a Hormel Compleat for the first time?  OK, then just remember these reviews on Amazon -- particularly food reviews -- are all simply opinions of customers, no scientific analysis intended (I hope).<br /><br />Compleats are quick, easy (except for pulling the plastic off the top) and generally edible.  There's not a whole lot more to say about them.  I eat them because I'm an old guy living alone and too often I'm just lazy.  These do come in handy for a quick light meal.  ""Light"" depending on your appetite and the size of your tummy.<br /><br />This is a good one to lead off with if you're just now getting into Compleats.  Just note that, in my opinion, it's middle of the road for the line.  Not a lot of flavor; but goes down OK.",Neutral
"I've tried several of the Compleats line, including this one, and they all have one thing in common: the picture on the box looks like a lot of food with a moderate amount of sauce on it, but the box actually contains a moderate amount of food with a lot of sauce on it.<br /><br />The Chicken and Rice flavor has some shredded chicken with rice, carrots and peas and a whole lot of chickeny flavored sauce. It's very salty but not lacking in chicken flavor. The texture of all of the ingredients is decent, neither too firm nor too mushy, except for the ratio of sauce to solid food being too saucy. Overall, I'd say it's fine in a pinch - these shelf-stable meals are easier to find than most - but if you have other options available, these are only fair-to-middlin'.",Neutral
"Like the majority of other meals in the Hormel line, this one is excessively salty. That alone is tolerable though if only the meal wasn't swimming in sauce. This ends up being more like a soup than a rice meal which is an utter shame because everything else is fairly nice and the enormous amount of sauce ruins it.<br /><br />But it's very quick and easy to make and fills you up so even a blah meal like this fits the bill. It's not my favorite of this type of meals but I wouldn't turn it down for lunch one hungry afternoon.",Neutral

Still, if you're like me and want to avoid the stores as much as possible, maybe paying a $1 more for 24 isn't such a big deal. Nutritionally its pretty meh. You could do a lot better. But its also a versatile base- you can always add lots of veggies, meat, other spices, pretty much anything to this to dress it up and make it a better meal option.

"For a 220 calorie dish that can sit in your desk drawer indefinitely, this really isn't bad. It's certainly better than Chef Bouyardee or Easy Mac or actual Cup of Noodles. I've only ever had one other Dr. McDougall's product which was the Tortilla Soup and I much preferred it. I found this one to be a bit bland. It was pretty much just dried Cup of Noodles type noodles with some peanutty powder and a few green onions. I think the peanut flavor could have been more pronounced and I wasn't crazy about the texture of the noodles. I guess I was hoping for a bit more than ramen with peanut sauce.<br /><br />I only gave this three stars because I thought it was a bit of a let down. I liked it but I didn't love it as much as I should have given my love of peanut sauce. I would maybe buy it again at a grocery store if it was on sale but I certainly don't see myself buying them in bulk from amazon. My go-to Desk Drawer food is still Annie Chun's Udon Noodle Soup Bowl. The calorie count is pretty similar (I think Annie Chun's is like 280 or so) but the texture of the noodles is far superior because they use the vacuum sealed pre-cooked noodles.

"Not bad for a prepackaged and quickie meal. If you're looking for authentic Thai, this will give you only half the flavor, so the name that it is only a taste of Thai is quite accurate. Cartons are fancy, but big for the amount they hold. It is definitely enough for a meal, but if you're looking for a full takeout carton of food to eat, you had better grab two. It is tasty enough for a meal, but if you can get yourself to an authentic Asian supermarket, I guarantee you will find much tastier options that are also quick and easy to make with more substance and flavor and at a much lower price (ie 6 boxes of noodles for $6) - and I'm not talking about Cup O' Noodles or things you find at American supermarkets. But overall, my husband and I, being the noodle-mongers that we are, did enjoy these as something new for the palate.

I have a finicky stomach, and so I'm fine with things that taste low-fat and healthy, since those are mostly what I eat. But these have all the fat and calories of chips that are fried and even more than those that are baked, so I'm undecided on if I want more chips that have a healthy taste with all the fat. The all natural ingredients are what make this chip different, and what might bring me back for more. It's definitely one of those snacks you have to try for yourself, and see if you like them or not.",Neutral
I expected from the extremely positive reviews on the site for full flavor healty chips. In reality I get an OKAY taste with a strange aftertaste on basically all of the flavors. Chedder and Salt&Pepper honestly being some of the worst tasting chips I've ever had.

In the end I compare these chips to diet soda vs regular; Some won't tell the difference while some will immediately sense it and hate it.,Neutral

"I really wanted to like these. All the reviews made it seem supernal, and, well as advertised, it's not fried nor baked.<br /><br />However, even though it is advertised as being ""healthy"" but still with plenty of flavor, that flavor just means each chip is loaded with salt. I only looked at the nutrition facts after I felt they were too salty, and I discover that a 100cal bag contains 10% dv of sodium.<br /><br />I'm not a health nut, nor am I trying to diet. These were my first food purchase from amazon, and I bought them because they were at the top of the search list and seemed to be a best seller. However, I just couldn't get into these chips.<br /><br />I realize that the flavour of the chips is up to each individuals' tastebuds, and so I will say that these are perfect for those who enjoy chips with strong flavor.

"Bought these based on the glowing reviews (4 1/2 Stars), and the fact that they were heavily discounted from the regular price. First of all .8 oz. per bag equals about 15 or 16 chips per bag, which is not many. While this may be fine for those who are trying to cut back on calories, fat or sodium, the fact is that .8 of an ounce is not much, and that might tempt people to eat more than one bag at a time.  Due to the discounted price each bag was around $.55 each, not to bad until you figure that equals $10 per pound. At the regular price its about $16 per pound. As far as the taste, all of the flavors were good, none that I absolutely disliked, but none that really rocked my socks either. Bottom line, at the discounted price I paid I was not disappointed, but if I had paid the regular price for these I would have felt cheated.",Neutral
I actually purchased these. I myself find that they taste just like those like rice crisp with salt and flavoring. From the reviews I thought they was more like munchos. They are not.

"I like to take my lunch to work and this is perfect to give me just enough chips that I can munch on with my lunch. I love the flavors and the packaging is perfect. Worth the buy!  The price is right, the flavors are just what they want, portion size is good thus it's a win, win situation for me and them.",Neutral
"I really like the pop chips, but I do not like all the flavors. The only ones I like are the originals.  The rest of these flavors were really not good.  At least not in my family.  I gave them away to a senior center and most of the seniors didnt like them.  Sorry but it is a matter of taste and most things should stick to the originals, they are the best.<br /><br />This snack (originals) fits into my daily ww program for allot less money then snacks made for the programs specifically.<br /><br />I will continue to buy the originals and leave the others to others.",Neutral
"Good texture: they are crunchy and not sharp (will not cut mouth)<br /><br />Flavor: They do not taste like potato chips. If I had not just opened the bag I would suspect they were stale. But no this is how they taste. Many others have remarked about the odd flavor as well.<br /><br />Healthy: good for dieting I suppose, low oil, and low salt<br /><br />I will not be buying these again.",Neutral
Next time I will order only the original flavor.  The other flavors did not suit me.  Too much of an aftertaste.,Neutral
"These taste alright, but they are health food by no means. At least regular potato chips are just greasy potato slices. This products is made of processed potato by-product and is natural by no means. The calorie savings isn't even significant enough to give up the better taste of potato chips. Also keep in mind that the healthiest part of a potato chip is the oil (if eaten in moderation) because of the healthy dose of balanced fats. In my opinion if you want a healthy chip eat sun chips or a cracker like triscuits. If you want a potato chip eat a real potato chip. If you feel these taste better than the above, then by all means enjoy, but don't be tricked into believing these are healthy at all.<br />Overall 4 stars for taste and 2 stars for the marketing scam that they are.",Neutral
"I purchased these because I was hoping for a healthy alternative to chips. Well, they're fairly healthy: absolutely no oily residue on the hands and very light and airy. However, I just couldn't get over the taste, which I can only liken to slightly burnt popcorn. If that undercurrent of ""burnt"" flavor wasn't there, these might have been more palatable, but my taste buds kept zeroing in on that one aspect. Also, the seasonings weren't consistently strong. Cheddar was o.k. Bbq was probably the closest match to regular potato chips...the flavor was straight from a bag of Lays. However, I was very disappointed with the Sour Cream and Onion which was just too light in flavor and the Vinegar and Salt which didn't have as strong a tang as I would have liked.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these to someone who wanted to eat healthy and didn't mind a watered down version of a fried chip. However, I just couldn't stomach them. I gave away the unopened bags to coworkers (none of which were impressed either but they're not on diets...lucky dogs). For now, I'll stick with my baked goldfish and bunny crackers.",Neutral
I bought this as a gift for my mother. She likes it but says it is hard to open. When she unwrapped it I remember having to help her figure out how to open it. It took me a minute. If you have arthritis you won't be able to pry this open!,Neutral
"I've had a couple of these for a few years but find that I don't use them all that often because their size & design limits their usefulness. For bushy herbs like cilantro or parsley it only holds a small bunch, and it's difficult to keep the bunch together while you snap the lid back on. Since the bottom cup is so shallow herbs tend to flop out the front unless you lay the pod down when first filling it. It works great for asparagus, but only for small-ish bunches and if the spears aren't too tall.<br /><br />More often than not I simply use a canning jar + 1/2"" of water with a plastic bag over the top, which keeps the contents just as fresh and allows for easier access. These pods do look much nicer in the fridge than a bag-topped-jar, however, and the clear front makes it harder to forget what's in there.<br /><br />They are definitely well made and not prone to leaking or tipping over. And the little drain port is fun to use.<br /><br />But it only works for small bunches.",Neutral
I got one of these for XMAS...and to be honest it does work well and does extend the life of your fresh herbs while providing an attractive container.<br /><br />The main problem is the container is difficult to open. It does get easier over time but whoever designed this thing should not have made it so hard from the get go.<br /><br />The thing is its very easy to open when there is nothing inside it as you can you use as much force as needed open it (you don't need to open the bottom....just squeeze the sides and pull the plastic cover up and out FIRMLY). Don't worry...you won't break it. It is pretty sturdy plastic.<br /><br />The real issue is when it is filled or has water in it...its difficult to use that much force and popping it open without spilling.<br /><br />I've just resorted to emptying the water reservoir through its fill port....then popping it.<br /><br />PREPARA...please read these reviews and improve on the next design!!!,Neutral
"I tried Tropical Pineapple it was delicious. I gave a bad review for Tropical Fruit Salad becuase it had watermelon and pineapple in it I think the two of these were competeing for the flavor. I see now thats what I think it was, probably not a bad product at all. Sue",Neutral
"This fruit would be fine if it were not for the soft slimey textured watermelon and some other fruit that is in this can that is just slimey and icky. There are certain fruit that shouldn't be canned, and otherwise the crunchy pieces are fine. Much of the soft fruit I had to discard. Albeit, this item is good frozen and added to other fruit to make smoothie's then you don't have to taste the slime.",Neutral

"Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix is definitely a mouthful in name but, in taste, not so much.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad but, you could find any number of ""mixes"" that taste just as well and some even better.  I know my taste buds aren't the same as yours so, what's just decent to me may be great to you.  I also wish I had bought just one can instead of 2 huge 33 ounce cans.  I finished the first can, I'll give the other can away and, I'll continue trying other mixes until I find the ""best mix"" out there.<br /><br />So far I seem to only be satisfied with a homemade mix for my waffles.  My preference is for waffles over pancakes but, this didn't make it on either count.  I even tried adding things to it but it didn't really help.  Maybe it's just me.  Try it if you like but remember, buy only one can just in case you're like me.  You can always buy more.",Neutral
"I love this pancake mix. Can not find this exact one in any stores so I always order online and keep in stock at home. All you do is mix with water (I add fresh chopped banana's or strawberries for a healthy option, and swap syrup for honey) and cook in a lil butter and you have an awesome breakfast.",Neutral
The best thing about this pancake and waffle mix is the can in which it comes.  I really like the convenience of the can and the fact that it reseals easily.<br />The batter cooked up nicely and the texture was OK.  However I was very disappointed in the flavor.  There were stong overtones of chemical flavors.<br />I will be experimenting with my own recipes in the future.,Neutral
"Been curious about Stonewall since reading all the Amazon reviews but not sure about spending $$$ for a pancake mix.  The other day, found a big can at Sur La Tab store in San Francisco for only $10.95, so I thought, why not, this is my chance to try.  I was so looking fwd to Saturday morning and made it first thing today....all I can say is, underwhelming, nothing special.  I tried it following the instructions but using low fat milk and ""healthier"" butter, it was alright, but not great esp. considering the price.  Then I doctored it up a bit, added madagascar vanilla, flaxseed and psyllium which I usually do with my pancakes, tasted a bit better. Overall rating, 3 stars, just ok, stuck with the can so we'll eat it, but will not purchase again.  I will probably try it next time with full fat milk and butter as it recommended to see if that makes a difference, it probably does. I highly recommend Garvey's Organic Pancake Mix, also here in Amazon, tastes so much better and fluffier.  If you like 100% whole grain pancakes, we also love Kodiak Buttermilk mix, also here on Amazon...healthy, hearty and so good, even my kids love it...and best of all it's just add water, makes it portable, we even took it with us on vacay to Hawaii.",Neutral
"When I read the reviews from other customers, I was excited about ordering and trying this mix. This morning we made waffles with both Stonewall Kitchen mix and Bisquick. The waffles from Stonewall were ok- and so were the waffles from Bisquick. The waffles were served to several people for tasting and everyone felt the same.<br /><br />The agreement was that Stonewall Kitchen product was not worth the significant extra cost. Furthermore, it is not available in our local super market whereas Bisquick is stocked. This will be a one time purchase for us.",Neutral
I am constantly on the search for delicious buttermilk pancakes because they are my favorite food in the world.  I like to make my own or get them at the Original Pancake House (which has the best buttermilk pancakes I have ever tasted).  I decided to try this box mix variation even though I am not a fan of box mixes.  The Stonewall brand has a very aromatic scent but that's where I ceased to be impressed.  These pancakes hardly rise at all and have a decent flavor and texture but are nothing to gush over.  Then again I guess I'm one of the few who would gush over a plain bettermilk pancake anyway!!  They're ok but not worth all that money.,Neutral

"This mix makes nice pancakes. They smell rich and vanilla-y, but you don't actually  taste it as strong as it smells. I won't buy them again because there are easier mixes out there that taste pretty darn close. I'm just as happy using a Krusteaz brand mix that only requires the addition of water (no eggs or milk or flour necessary). Heck, if you want that vanilla smell and taste, add an eighth or quarter teaspoon of some extract to your batter.<br /><br />Edited for grammar's sake.",Neutral
"I bought the mix at the same time as the Oster 3874 waffle maker and have been pleased with the results: light, well baked waffles that tasted good.  My problems with the mix were first the expense, secondly that the mix is very finely ground and flies around when poured and there may some sort of perfume added to it.  It simply smells too good.<br /><br />I am happy with the product but will probably not reorder it.",Neutral

"The title of my review says it all (as long as it didn't get cut off). These have a lot more air in them than the Gerber Little Crunchies. These crush extremely easily and get dust/crumbs all over the place. Also, they do not taste nearly as good as the Gerber Little Crunchies. They might be better for you, and I like that it has a hint of veggies in it, but my 17 month old isn't very happy with them. She'll snack on them if that's her only option and she's really hungry, but she definitely will not choose them. We first got these several months ago and she's had the same reaction to them every time since then.",Neutral
"I really wanted my kids to love it: these are very convenient on the go and should be delicious... or so it seemed.

It has chunks of potatoes, carrots, and peas, not to mention chicken and apples. The only downside about ordering it from Amazon is the delivery method. The day the food was delivered, a van pulled up in front of my house and left the 5 cases of food I had ordered outside of my chain link fence next to the mailbox. Needless to say, someone could have taken it if I hadn't seen the delivery woman drop it off. I'm also disabled, and if it hadn't been for my next-door neighbor being outside at the time, I couldn't have gotten the cases of food into my house without her help. Many of the cans were also extremely dented. Delivering items this way is not acceptable. I would have given this review 5 stars if it hadn't been for the delivery.",Neutral
"so far, nothing extremely impressive. the taste to be honest isn't anything special (i've had MUCH better) and for the price you get what you pay for. a bit annoyed that the string is super cheap and always falls off but it came nicely packaged and arrived MUCH faster than i expected (by like 5 days) so i suppose that's a plus. all in all, if you're looking for something extravagant, keep looking. as for the 'benefits', haven't really noticed anything new... but i'll keep drinking for a couple weeks and see how that goes, then update my review... till then, yeah maybe i should i invested in something else (but since it was barely any money i guess i didn't do too bad)..",Neutral
"This is NOT real peanut satay but for the price it is not bad. I like to get these and keep them in my desk at work for the days that I don't have time to go out to lunch.

"The Amazon product info claims they are a certified organic product.  The picture claims DOP certified.  Neither appears to be true.

Maybe.  If couldn't get any of the Strianese D.O.P. certified San Marzano tomatoes, then yes I probably would.

I love coconut water. I love pineapple juice. I love lightly flavored coconut water. This tastes like none of the above. The flavor is sickly sweet (ingredients included added sugar), and with none of the nice mellow coconut flavor of other coconut waters I've tried. Might as well be a processed kids drink.<br /><br />Alternatives: While I actually prefer O.N.E.'s regular, unflavored coconut water over other brands, the Vita Coco coconut water with a splash of pineapple is far superior to this one. It comes in a larger package, doesn't have added sugar, has more vitamins and nutrients (this one is diluted with sugar water), and tastes like you're drinking it fresh on the beach. This one is just...not great.",Neutral

Given that it claims to have a ""splash of pineapple"", I was expecting a light pina-colada flavour.<br /><br />On opening the package, I could smell the hint of pineapple, and I'd say the taste of pineapple is a bit stronger than the coconut water.  Probably because I've mostly tasted coconut milk and not water, I'd say this was nothing like what I expected.  It's not bad for thirst quenching, but it wasn't my favourite drink in terms of taste.",Neutral
"hi every one I just wanted to share some of my experience with you about this product. First off all it taste pretty good but its kinda sugary and salty. Its an ok drink but when you think about it and you compare it to others this drink is not as healthy as others. Its more like a juice drink than a healthy one. Compared to Vitacoco it has more calories, twice the sodium, half the potassium and almost half the vitamin C. This drink also has less magnesium, phosphorous, and 4 times less calcium.

"This soup is very good tasting if you like seafood, like I do. I am finally finishing my case of cans, because it is good food. However, I do not plan on getting any more of this particular product because every can has a little something extra: bits and pieces of chitinous shell, mostly from the shrimp but also a few hard pieces now and then from the lobster. They are small pieces, which means taking small spoonfuls and not biting down hard on anything, and don't eat the last spoonful. I find six to eight pieces of this debris in each can. Like I said before, I am finishing the case, because it is food and pretty good at that. But I just don't appreciate having to be that careful with my soup.",Neutral

"I have bought ground flax in the store, there was always a rancid aftertaste.  This is the best tasting flax I have ever had.

Nothing like working a bite trying to find where the rock you just bit is.<br /><br />After you grind, sift the powder and black stones will be evident.  I have about 1-2 per quarter cup of ground mixture.

"I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity ""kool-aid"" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price.",Neutral
"When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)",Neutral
"This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected.",Neutral
"I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea.",Neutral

We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping.

"I've had better canned clam chowder.  Bookbinders is one that comes to mind.  I don't buy the ones with preservatives or a long list of ingredients, so my choice is limited.  For this one, if I add just half a can of milk and a pat of butter, along with some extra sea salt, it's ok.  The longer it is gently heated -- not simmered or boiled -- to let the flavors mingle, the better it becomes.  More clams and potatoes would improve it.  As it is, the ingredients were skimpy.",Neutral
"We had high expectations for this product but the chowder was only average.  Warming instructions are vague as to the amount of milk and/or butter to blend in with the soup mix.

Two of them were severely dinged on the seamlines and had to be tossed.  For this reason, we will no longer purchase can goods through the mail.",Neutral

I'm going to buy some chopped clams to kind of ""chum"" a bit. This, of course increases the cost of the meal. I'm going to try some other brands as well.<br /><br />I do hope that Bar Harbor does some testing. The label shows clams as the most prevalent ingredient, but I don't see how that can be -- my money is on the potatos.",Neutral

It's the best CANNED clam chowder I've ever had, but it's not that great. The clams taste good.<br /><br />EDIT: I had a 2nd can and I made it today, I added only a little bit of milk and I added NO salt, pepper, or butter, and it actually tastes a lot better than when I did. So I suggest adding nothing but some milk or cream to this soup. It's still not the best I've ever had though.",Neutral

"It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!",Neutral
"With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of ""100 calorie"" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.",Neutral
"Sorry, but I wasn't terribly impressed by these light snack crackers. Okay, I admit that I never liked Oreos that much in the first place. This 100 calorie bag of thin snack crackers tastes like Oreos, for sure--minus the sugar high pasted in the traditional sandwich cookie filling. But as one other reviewer noted, they're not all that chocolaty, a critical flaw in the opinion of this chocoholic. Worse than that, they're not so good for you. If you're going to have 100 calories, there are a lot healthier ways to do so than devoting nearly 40 percent to sugar. For my money, a piece of fruit makes a lot more sense. It not only costs less, it's got lots more nutritional value, not to mention fibre.",Neutral

"This is good popcorn, I have purchased before in Hawaii.  I was happy to see that I can order online.  However, I purchase the 20 pack and they overstuffed the box.  There is no bubble wrap or any type of wrapping around the individual packages before they put it into the box.  They choose a small box that can barely fix all twenty packages.  It is overstuffed to the point that the box is no longer squared, but rounded somewhat.  The postal service does not treat the package with care, so when it arrived, there was a wet stain.  When we opened it, two packages had been damaged, and the butter leaked all over all the other packages.  We had to spend a long time washing all the packages, because they are all greasy.  The greasiness does not wash off easily even with soap.  Now when eating them, some of the other packages of popcorn got water in them because of the washing, they are not air-tight packages.  So when popping them, there are a lot of unpopped kernels.  They should use bigger boxes and wrap it better.",Neutral
"Although I think this pen is great...I didn't receive the entire roll of polytape..even after calling customer service...and I think the height of the posts is misleading..hence the 3 stars.  If I wanted to buy a new energizer and more polytape then it would be great to own, as my review below states:<br /><br />Easy one-page instructions and everything fits nicely back inside the bag, without struggling...<br /><br />I needed this portable paddock for my goats because I have a lot of unfenced acreage beyond the barn area.  I was worried about the fence being suitable for goats so I called Customer Service...The rep went to a lot of trouble and checked this for me and said it would work fine for goats as well.  However, several days later, I called back and spoke to another rep and he said that goats needed much higher voltage.  This particular energizer is 3,000 volts and that goats needed 5,000 to 8,000 volts. But he said I could just buy another pulse type energizer and it would work with the tape that I have.  I have older, very mellow goats so the 3,000 volts are working so far.<br /><br />I have different breeds and therefore different heights of goats and one concern was that the clips on the post wouldn't be low enough to the ground for my mixed breed goats but on the post, it has clips all the way down so that the tape can be hung at various heights.  However, even though the post is listed as 4ft high, I measured and they are actually 47 1/8  inches tall and after you push the metal tip into the ground, you are left with a height of 38 inches.  The tape rests at the bottom of the top clip which holds the tape at 35 inches off the ground.  Seems awfully short for horses but I don't know anything about horses either.<br /><br />The instructions are clear and has helpful diagrams, making it all very easy to put together.  I did have problems at the end tying it to the last post.  I had to call Customer Service, and the rep said that you CANNOT unroll the whole spool of polytape if you are hanging it to the last post via the spool, which is per the instructions.  Since I had already unrolled it to the end, I had to tie the end of the polytape to the post or to the empty spool container, which he said was okay, but then it's not easy to untie that knot.<br /><br />In lieu of posts, you can hang the guy wire around trees and then slide the electric tape through the loop.  Guy wires, which are similar to tent stakes give the posts extra stability, but I saw no need for them at all since the clay soil held the posts very well.<br /><br />My ground is hard clay but the fence posts sunk in easily, despite that.  It had rained within the last week though so it may be different depending on the dryness of the soil.  The posts are sturdy, and strong enough to not break with normal use.  I did have gravel in some spots which made me have to relocate a few posts, since the tips would not go past them.<br /><br />There is no mention of the tape being allowed to touch weeds and grass, so I called Customer Service back to find that out. He said that that only a low impedance energizer can be used near grass and this energizer is NOT low impedance.  So, I had to mow where I wanted to put the fence to avoid any problems with grounding.  Not very practical when out on the road.<br /><br />Planning the fence was harder than I imagined because I couldn't make a perfect square and I thought I had measured correctly but still fell short of where I wanted the fence to end.  I then discovered that I was only given 126 feet of polytape rather than the 200 feet.  Doing a trial run of setting the fence up is recommended.<br /><br />I wanted something that was easy.  I'm a small middle-aged female and needed something that wasn't too much trouble so I could move it around without a lot of sweat and tears.  This is perfect for my goat situation if they had just sent me the correct length tape.  It seems too short for horses but I posted the measurements in case it helped someone who has horses.",Neutral
"I really liked these cookies when they first came out.  But then I got a little tired of them.  They have a bit of a gritty texture, and they don't taste the way you hope they will when thinking of an Oreo.  They are worth eating if you have a bad craving, but I can't eat more than one or two.  The different taste gets to me.  There may be an ingredient in them that doesn't agree with me.  They contain vegetable oils, just like Oreos do.  Palm oil is in practically everything these days because it is cheap for companies to use.  When I eat it, it leaves a thick, greasy film in my mouth and throat.  Store-made cake frostings, cookies, cupcakes...anything that has it leaves that feeling, and I don't like it at all.  Some are worse than others, making it hard to swallow.  This happened when I ate a double-stuf chocolate WhoNu cookie.  Palm oil is listed as an ingredient.  I stopped buying them and the regular chocolate.  I only get the vanilla version.  They contain palm oil as well, but I'm guessing it is less because they don't bother me.  I like them much better.  It's weird because I like chocolate sandwich cookies better than vanilla ones in general.  But with Whonu, the vanilla wins for me.<br /><br />Yesterday I had a craving for a chocolate sandwich cookie, and I bought Oreos.  Even Oreos don't taste as good as they used to.  I guess since the trans fat change in products.  The WhoNu cookies have the extra vitamins and nutrients, and less sodium.  But the Oreos have a better flavor.  The difference in fat content doesn't seem to be very different.  Actually, the difference in sodium doesn't seem very significant, either.  I decided I'd rather eat a few Oreos than a few of these.  It's something you have to decide for yourself when comparing the pros and cons.",Neutral
"I was really looking forward to the Dulce de Leche Cheerios.  The Honey Nut flavor has been my favorite since they came out and the thought of caramel was quite appealing.<br /><br />The first few spoonfuls seemed quite yummy.  But the more I ate, the less I enjoyed it.  The caramel flavor seemed a bit off to me or maybe it was that these are more corn than oat so the flavor was different from that as well.  (Oats are the third ingredient after corn and sugar; I thought Cheerios were always oat cereals.) All things considered (especially price), I'll stick with Honey Nut.<br /><br />They tasted pretty good just plain from the box so I think I'll save them for when I want a slightly sweet snack but not too sugary.  I'll pour out a handful and eat them like a toddler!<br /><br />I expected these to be more sugary than the Honey Nut but these have 6 grams of sugar per serving compared to 9 grams for the Honey Nut.  But they have the same total carbohydrates, 22 grams per serving, so there isn't much difference in how it affects your body.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I won't buy them again.",Neutral

Yay me!<br /><br />Sometimes i still think about this water, longing for it as i sip my coffee or tea or ramen-juice and say to myself ""This would be so much better with talking rain.""<br /><br />Its one college student's battle between deliciousness and eco-friendliness.",Neutral

"Even on the small cup setting of the elite, these are a little weak for me.  Make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak.  I also run a cup of hot water thru the maker before using these so there is no coffe taste to them.",Neutral
Makes pretty good cocoa and a lot easier than on the stovetop.  Not as sweet as I would prefer and needs to be stirred to keep it in suspension.  I guess I can add marshmallows:-),Neutral
"It's okay but it does not have a rich chocolatey taste. I actually find it to have a funky taste, can't quite figure it out.",Neutral
"I was expecting something more... considering the Keurig does such a good job with coffee.<br />But this stuff? Everybody who sampled it here said it tasted just like Nestle's powdered hot chocolate in a mug with hot water. Watery, sugary, and nothing special.",Neutral
"I saw these on sale so I nabbed them.  For anything larger than a 6oz cup, the results will be too weak.  I end up brewing one with 6oz of water and then a cappuccino or something on top of it.<br /><br />The peppermint was the flavor I was anxious to try but it ended up being the dark chocolate that I loved the most.  I'm on the fence about ordering hot cocoa k-cups in the future.  It might be better to stick with canned cocoa and just use the water from my Keurig.",Neutral

This product is nice and the price is right but it isn't Swiss Chocolate for sure.<br /><br />Just doesn't have that real deep chocolate taste.,Neutral
"I bought this brand of hot chocolate K cups cause it had the best review on Amazon at the time.  The kids love it - they especially like the peppermint flavor which I can't see any other way to get except in this mixed box.  You get milk chocolate, dark chocolate and peppermint flavors.  I tried it a few times and it is too weak for my taste.  I make it on the lowest setting on my Keurig which I think is around 7 ounces and it is still weak to me but perfect for them.  If you like a strong chocolate flavor this isn't it.",Neutral
"I HATE SUCRALOSE.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know how other people CAN'T taste it when it's in sweetened products. It's got this unpleasant fake flavor that I just can't ignore. I think any company that uses that junk should be required by law to indicate it on their box and all advertising.<br /><br />That being said, it seems like this hot cocoa has less sucralose than the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, and as such I have to give it higher marks than the competition.<br /><br />Still, I can't believe this product AND its nearest competitor use sucralose but don't say they're a diet, lite, low-sugar, or otherwise unnaturally-sweetened product. It's frustrating. I can taste the stuff, and I really dislike it. I also don't like the chemical makeup of sucralose, but I won't go into that here (just believe me: natural sugar is way better for you in the long run).<br /><br />There's one other choice out there for a hot cocoa in a K-Cup, and that's Swiss Miss. Unfortunately, the Swiss Miss K-Cups are ridiculously high priced and hard to find.<br /><br />My opinion? It's probably better if you just get your favorite hot cocoa in packets, and use the hot water function of your Keurig. It's not worth the K-Cup convenience if you have to put up with artificial sweeteners or significantly higher prices. Spending more than seventy-five cents per cup of water-based hot cocoa is about the limit for me.<br /><br />So, if you're into sucralose/Splenda, then by all means grab this and enjoy that weird aftertaste and decidedly not-sugar flavor. If you're like me, though, and can't stand that artificial stuff, then avoid this product and find another option.<br /><br />Three stars for tasting decent despite the awful artificial sweetener. Minus two stars for being artificially sweetened and not mentioning it anywhere.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just found out that the Swiss Miss K-Cups also use sucralose. So really, your only choice is to get packets and use your Keurig as a hot water dispenser. How disappointing.<br /><br />UPDATE 02/12: After some research, I found that there is one K-Cup hot cocoa that doesn't have sucralose; However, it is loaded with fructose instead (not the greatest trade-off, since it tastes different from sugar/sucrose, in my opinion) and has no actual sugar/sucrose in it. That one is Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa. Unfortunately, reviews of it say it has a strong coconut flavor (probably because the second ingredient is coconut oil) and is on the salty side, so I have avoided it. It's also more expensive per-cup, and unless you think a single cup of cocoa is worth over a dollar and twenty-five cents (as opposed to a box of 12 packets being around two dollars) then go ahead and try it. I will refrain at this point and stick to using packets.<br /><br />I would also like to clarify again that despite what some comments say, the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa K-Cups, Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa K-Cups, and Grove Square Hot Cocoa K-Cups ALL use sucralose. Yes, there is sugar in some of those, but it is IN ADDITION TO sucralose/Splenda, and not by itself.<br /><br />So your choices right now are pure sucralose, sucralose plus a sugar, or pure fructose. None of them is appetizing to me, and all of them make the cost per cup of cocoa quite unpleasant.<br /><br />43 servings of sugar-sweetened cocoa in a canister will run you around six bucks, and it's no more complicated than a K-Cup if you know how to operate a spoon.",Neutral
Does not have a rich chocolate flavor. Tastes a little watery. Not sure who a makes a great cocoa but this is not it.,Neutral
Good flavors in this combo. Not really strong but I will just set the machine on less water next time.,Neutral
"I like it ok, but it isn't anything great. I have a hot water tap and it is just as easy for me to make the powder packs at home at a fraction of the cost. I'll go back to that method and save my $$ for coffee.",Neutral
"Unfortunately, I am conflicted with my purchase.<br /><br />Although the final product was quite good, 4 stars. The quality of the delivery is why they lost an additional star. I opened the Amazon box to find that there was hot chocolate powder coming out of the Grove Square packaging. I opened it to find that 2 of the K-Cups weren't sealed properly on top and were spilling into the box. I inspected both the Amazon package and the Grove Square both of which had no visible exterior damage.<br /><br />I was disappointed with both Grove Square for the quality of their product and as a result I am not sure I would buy this product again.",Neutral

"Fortunately, before I purchased I read through enough reviews of these k-cups to discover that they add some artificial sweetener to them along with sugar.  I'm shocked that the item descriptions don't make this clear.  I consider that important information!<br /><br />I decided to give them a try, anyway, considering some reviewers thought it was hard to tell.  I realize that many products do this recently, but they usually fall short of hiding that nasty aftertaste.<br /><br />Sadly, this one does too.  It's close - I can almost enjoy a cup - but it's still unmistakable, especially if you don't consume much artificial sweetener.  (I chew sugar-free gum, and that's it for me.)<br /><br />It's a shame, too, because the chocolate flavor is nice.  In fact, I rated these a 3 simply because my son tolerates the sweetener enough to drink them.  And I was really jazzed about the caramel cappuccino before I found out about the sweetener...but now I won't be buying any.  (Side note: many cappuccino reviewers complained that they're instant coffees that taste like gas station cappuccino - that would be fine with me, if it weren't for the artificial sweetener which those gas station cappuccinos don't have.)<br /><br />If they begin to offer a line without the artificial sweetener, I'd buy it, but until then I'm staying away from Grove Square products.",Neutral
"Just tried this for the first time today.  They are ""ok"", but they do have an odd aftertaste.  Not sure I'll be ordering these again.  Also -- the packaging notes that you need to run a hot water cycle (without a k-cup) after making them (I assume to clean the machine out).",Neutral
I think the hot cocoa taste great but my wife thinks it is watery. My wife is a big Swiss Miss drinker and knows her hot cocoa. Not sure I will buy again because of the cost of paying for the k cups. Sometimes I think you are better off buying Swiss Miss packets and just use the hot water function on the k cup machine.,Neutral
"I didn't expect much from powdered cocoa in a cup, but here's a tip: put on 8oz setting, then add a 1:1 ratio of heated milk. It tastes amazingly good!<br /><br />Of course if you add a little Baileys Irish Cream, it tastes even better.",Neutral
"This has artificial sweetener just like the other hot chocolates out there. If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.",Neutral
"Everyone has their own preferences, I know -- I actually liked the flavor, but my wife tried it and couldn't stand how sweet it was.  To each his/her own, I guess.  But, now that I'VE had a second cup, I tend to agree -- very sweet.",Neutral
I bought this becaue they were $9.99 for the 24 pack.  I could try them for .50/cup.  Other in the store were almost $1/cup.  Overall they are ok/good but you need to run a hot water flush throuhg you maschine afetr each use or there is a potential to have the residue gunk up you drain area.,Neutral
"It wasn't a bad purchase at just $9.99 through Warehouse Deals fulfilled by Amazon and shipped for free, but took 2 stars off because it wasn't a freshness issue but Cracker Jacks® just don't taste the same like when I was a kid back in the 1980's.",Neutral

"I purchased cases of these for our company picnic. The boxes were cute, the idea of it all was a big hit. But the ""gift inside"" was a bust.

I find it to be misleading that they call it ""Original.""  Original had the gift inside.",Neutral
"I really liked this flavor!  As someone with many food sensitivities who also avoids sugar, this is the perfect treat for me when I crave chocolate or baked goods.  The raw nuts are crisp and fresh tasting.  However, the price was very high for the quantity of product.  With less than 20 brazil nuts in the package, I felt a little gipped.  In future, I'll try making my own chocolate nut mix from bulk raw nuts, berries, and coco powder rather than spend $9 per package!  For that price, I'd like a lot more product.",Neutral
"These arrived fresh and in a timely manner.  However, flavor-wise our family is in agreement that Jelly Belly produces a richer plum flavor, slightly larger sugar plum in size, and a bit softer in texture for their sugar plums.

"This item didn't have the pleasant taste that most of Hodgson Mills products have, such as the Wild Blueberry Muffin Mix.

"The Melitta Java Pods Have a slightly smaller circumference than the Senseo pods and are thicker. If you are using a Senseo coffee machine, you probably should moisten the Java pod and smooth it before attempting to latch the lid. Otherwise, you risk breaking the latching mechanism. The resulting decaf coffee is not bad and seems to this reviewer to have a richer taste than the Senseo decaf pods. The Melitta Java pods are not really designed for the Senseo machine and several other brands such as Halo, Fratello and Millstone work better in the Senseo machine.",Neutral
Some issues with the product -- some of the pods are not sealed properly so the grounds spill out (either before use or after use into your coffee); it is wasteful that each pod is individually sealed -- would rather they be packaged like the Senseo pods; the pods don't really fit my Senseo coffee maker -- too fat for the single and too small for the double which causes problems sometimes when I brew a cup.  On the plus side -- price.,Neutral
"Melitta pods are full flavored; however, they do not fit my senseo coffee machine.  One pod in a two pod holder is too small and two pods are too large.  Sure do wish senseo was still readily available in the super markets!",Neutral

Parisian Cafe' was not may favorite blend for breakfast coffee.  I prefer others of the Melitta brand.,Neutral
"If you're used to Dave's Insanity sauce, or like me you're used to Dave's Ultimate Insanity sauce, you're going to be really disappointed. 5 of the 6 sauces aren't spicy at all. They're probably at a spiciness level below Tobasco sauce. I tried really hard to like them but I just can't get over how watery and weak they are. The only saving grace of the package is that it comes with a bottle of regular Insanity sauce, but as I mentioned above, I prefer the Ultimate Insanity sauce. I guess I have plenty of salad dressings.",Neutral
I am a casual sauce user and the taste of these sauces was just OK.  Nothing special...  The insanity hot sauce was fun to try though.  I probably would not purchase again since they are pretty darn expensive.,Neutral

I know many of you will enjoy these and you'll probably rate these as a 5 star item, but I must be honest to provide the best rating possible. The 3 stars were for the lack of qualilty in taste.

"The level from this unit was hard to adjust, and when all was said and done, it was very low.",Neutral
It does record with ease and decent quality for the price. The only problem is it acts as a sound card and you can't record and listen to yourself at the same time without latency. This is a deal breaker for me. Blue microphones should add a headphone jack onto the interface so you don't have to listen to recordings through your computer and you can hear your recordings in real time.,Neutral
"Never really intended to use this in a professional setting so the noise issue is not that big of a deal. Just wanted a simple device that could fit in my backpack to interface with my laptop for impromptu interviews and music recordings. For the price paid, it's very cheap and lightweight plastic construction leaves much to be desired. Overall, I can not recommend this product at the current price it's sold at. 15 to 20 dollars, then sure. Still, it's an OK product.",Neutral

"Having recently been placed on a gluten free regime, I felt I needed some quick and easy help to get me started. It works great but is way too expensive for what it is.

I'm glad I tried this item because it taught me that I could do just as well on my own and save a great deal of money.",Neutral
"...this mix does have that grainy texture found with a lot of rice-based gluten-free mixes. The mix works well when the directions are followed and it is fairly versatile.<br /><br />I will use the mix I have, but I'm not sure if this will be a staple in my pantry. I'm not finding myself reaching for it on a regular basis, which is usually a sign that this isn't a hit in my household.",Neutral
"I bought this immediately after finding out I could no longer have gluten. From everything I was reading it seemed daunting to mix different flours to make anything.<br /><br />The boxes are SMALL!  While this mix is okay for making pancakes, the biscuits are alright, and to use it as a coating chicken fingers is 'eh', I'm glad I bought it when I was first diagnosed.  It helped ease my transition into gluten free cooking and baking.<br /><br />Now that I know what I'm doing, I will not buy again.  It's much cheaper to make my own flour mixes at home and use those to make pancakes, biscuits, and breaking for chicken fingers.  And my own mix tastes much better.  But, if you are new to gluten free, definetly pick this up, it will help with the transition!",Neutral
"The Bisquick Gluten Free was okay, but inferior to the Bob's Red Mill and Hodgson Mill products. Pancake batter, when made according to directions, was watery, resulting in flat pancakes.",Neutral

"My parents fell in love with 'San Francisco Bay Coffee Company' coffee, which use to be available at our local AZ Costco.

When I bought it (12/21/11) there was ""No Image Available"", should have been my first warning sign. They had lots of pictures of the 12oz bags of coffee from the San Francisco Bay Coffee Co, but I wanted something bigger, and this was 2 lbs. Now there is a picture availble, but if you look closely it's ""Roger's Family Company"" coffee, who is technically located near the San Francisco Bay Area. So if you're in love with San Francisco Bay Coffee Company, don't buy this coffee.

"I'm not a coffee expert, but I know a good tasting coffee when I drink a cup. The Melitta Riviera is a light roast, with a nutty and creamy flavor. The aroma is just exhilarating. It left a nice aroma throughout the house, almost made it seem like I was in a coffee shop. Unfortunately, it is just decaffeinated and did not give me the jolt I need in the morning.<br /><br />The packaging caused some problems for me. The seal is excessively tight. I've never had this problem with Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, Peet's Coffee, or Meijer packs. With the Melitta, it was so tight that when I did open it, the bag tore apart and spilled a lot of the ground coffee onto my kitchen top and floor. One could argue that this tight seal packs in all the flavor, I could argue that if it were easier to open I wouldn't have spilled maybe 3 days worth of coffee grounds onto the floor.<br /><br />Pros: Light roast, excellent aroma, nutty and creamy taste<br /><br />Cons: Decaf (arggghhh) and hard to open pack<br /><br />Overall: 3/5",Neutral
"I have a pretty wide appreciation for acceptable coffee, but in my opinion, this stuff is mediocre coffee. I drink both regular and decaf on a daily basis and to me, this tasted like institutional cafeteria coffee. I am normally a fan of the ""Swiss water decaffeination process"" decaf coffees, and was disappointed by the quality of this ""gourmet"" coffee.<br /><br />With that said, I did try this twice to give it a fair review. The first time I prepared it the same way I normally make my coffee (on the strong side), the second time I followed the directions exactly. Both times using filtered water and a quality coffee maker that uses the Melitta style (cone) filter. To my taste, it was stale and over-ground (like the flavor was watered out of it and then over-roasted and ground extra fine to try and put some flavor back into it), comparable in quality to low-end bulk coffee. The brands of decaf coffee I do like and brew at home (Dunkin' and Newman's Own, to name only two) are in the same price range, and also purchased pre-ground, but to me taste much smoother, and more full-flavored. This coffee is not one I would make a point to purchase when there are better coffee choices for the same money -or cheaper coffee choices for the same quality.",Neutral
"The price is great but I just didn't like the taste of this coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong. This one produce very acidic coffee when made strong, but if you make it thin, then it tastes okay with just slight acidic after taste. How you'd like this coffee is really depending on your personal taste of coffee, but if you are like me, drink coffee strong, or dislike acidic after taste that lasts while, then this is not for you.",Neutral

"This ground decaffeinated coffee makes a fine brew with a rich aroma and flavor. It is smooth and satisfying with a full-bodied taste. My wife and I loved the taste and aroma of this ground coffee. For an ideal cup measure one heaping teaspoon full of coffee per cup of hot water. You could change the quantity depending on the strength of the coffee you desire. I generally drink decaffeinated Folgers's brand, and when I compared the two brands, I did not find a great deal of difference in the richness of coffee. You may want to consider the price variance between the two brands before you want to purchase this product.",Neutral
"Not much of a decaf drinker (unless I am craving a cup late night for some reason). I have to say, this coffee tasted average at best. I am a WAWA coffee fan, and coming from them to this.. well it missed the mark. I gave some to my mother in law and she seemed happy with it, so 3 stars in that respect. I might try mixing it with my non-decaf coffee to see how it tastes, but I am not holding my breath. If the price was a few $$ cheaper, definitely would bump it up a star.",Neutral
"If you are truly looking for a decaf that will no longer make your heart race, this is not the coffee for you. It is quite flavorful, so I do recommend it to those who can still tolerate a bit of kick in their coffee.",Neutral
"Like most Melitta brews, I found this one to be somewhat middle of the road.  It's certainly not undrinkable, but it's not the first one I'd reach for, either.  As many of the other reviewers mentioned, I did find it nearly undrinkable when brewed in the quantity shown; I think you have to at least double the amount you use to get a good cup, so take that into consideration when figuring the value.<br /><br />I'm a little sensitive to caffeine and like to have a decaf on hand for drinking later in the day, and I bought this primarily to use with my Mr. Coffee frappe maker (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G"">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a>; let me just put in a quick pitch for that, I love it!)  I found the ""Riviera Sunset"" stood up well to all the milk, flavoring, and ice inherent in making a frappe (again, with a significant increase in the amount used).<br /><br />I would probably not purchase this coffee just because of my own views on coffee; I look for bird-friendly, Fair Trade brands, and I find nothing to indicate that Melitta makes any effort to meet these expectations.  Leaving aside these considerations, though, I think those who enjoy a somewhat light, easy-drinking brew would like this coffee.",Neutral
"Okay, I'm a complete coffee nut: I've even been known to grow my own beans, and when I run out of my private label, I tend to enjoy the baddest Kona or Jamaican Blue Mountain I can find.<br /><br />Still, sometimes I just want a quick cup of respectable coffee without all the fuss, and this is what I was hoping for in the Melitta Riviera decaf. To a good degree, I was happy with it, but it's certainly not something I'd curl up with when in the mood for a really outstanding cup of coffee.<br /><br />The positives are the aroma, the uniformity of the grind and the overall taste, which I'd rate as fairly mild and maybe a slight bit on the acid side. I found I liked it best either in a French press or in my Viviano espresso maker - two techniques that make the most out of somewhat weak coffee. Brewed conventionally, I found I could compensate by using somewhat more coffee than usual.<br /><br />Still, although not a serious competitor to the world's best coffees, it doesn't cost $50 a pound, either. I'd have to say that for the price, it's definitely worth trying.",Neutral
I'm not sure what all the fuss is about???  I thought it was a good coffee but not better than the store brand I usually  buy.  ..and beings the store brand is much cheaper... I'll stick with it.  It isn't bad coffee but I just don't seeing it being any better..,Neutral
"This makes a good pot of decaf.  Nothing remarkable - we have served this to many guests to no comments.  Nobody asked us what it was, but nobody spit it out, either :-).  It is smooth and not too strong, which is our preference.  We wouldn't hesitate to buy it again, but wouldn't go out of our way either.",Neutral
The coffee is good but it is nothing special. Compared to Maxwelhouse decafe this is nearly the same just slightly better. I don't feel it is worth the extra cash to buy this instead of a cheaper variety available anywhere. I did enjoy the coffee but I probably won't buy it again unless it would be deeply discounted.,Neutral
"First of all, when I opened my bag of Melitta decaf, it didn't have that strong, amazing rich coffee smell that my usual coffee has.  I brewed up a pot in my drip coffeemaker, and while it was ok, there was nothing outstanding about the taste.  It was bland and unremarkable compared to the coffee I normally drink.",Neutral
"The aroma of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta Cafe Collection Riviera Sunset Decaffeinated Ground Coffee, 10-Ounce Bags)</a> was fairly weak.

The taste was more than flavored water, but not amazingly so, with no subtle overtones. It wasn't bitter, but it wasn't much of anything.<br /><br />While I generally drink hi-test as opposed to decaffeinated, I do drink decaf at least twice a week. The <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta</a> was comparable to the generic brand that I usually have.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TMV3E4"">Melitta Cafe Collection riviera Sunset Decaf</a> isn't a bad coffee, but it's not worth the money if there are other options available.",Neutral
"Decaffeinated coffee is for most an oxymoron, for others an afterthought. It possesses few spots on grocery shelves and has shared little in the ""gourmet"" coffee line which changed how people accept this ancient drink into their lives. Comedian Bob Irwin even compared the blend to ""kissing your sister."" The day's first cup comes with a sense of entitlement; subsequent cups transition through the day (work, afternoon, dessert), while wanting both coffee's jolt and cozy sociability. (Instant? Don't get me started!)<br />That's why this new Melitta Riviera Sunset gourmet coffee is a pleasant surprise. It carries a full, almost nutty flavor without the bitter bite of the coffee which, for many, defines their image of coffee and its lifestyle. (This isn't surprising since Melitta's ad copy references the breezy feel of European cafes, a far cry from the irked lines at the morning coffee shop.)<br />No less than Henry Ward Beecher once said. ""No coffee can be good in the mouth that does not first send a sweet offering of odor to the nostrils.""  Riviera Sunset invites with its scent upon opening and doesn't disappoint when poured.(Hold to the preparation instructions; yours truly made one cup a little too strong and it came across a bit acidic.) Its taste, not its caffeine jolt, is your wake-up call. Recommended as a tastier, if somwhat pricier, alternative to major brands.",Neutral
"I'm not a coffee snob.  I can tell that there is a difference between Kenyan and Columbian, but I can't tell you which is which without a label.  This decaf tastes good.  I like mine with lots of fake sugar and cream; the coffee flavor isn't subdued by these additions.  The bag ultimately required scissors to open.  The blurb for this says ""(pack of 3)""; I only got one bag.  Not sure why that is; it's happened before with other products.  Would I buy this again?  Sure, if it was on sale . . . that's how I buy my coffee most of the time.",Neutral
"First off, I received a bag of this coffee via the Vine Program to review at no cost.  Secondly, I am more of a bold, ""slap-me-in-the-face"" French Roast coffee drinker (or StarBucks Gold Coast), so I had my reservations about this decaf.<br /><br />And ... Well, for me, this coffee had a somewhat stale aroma upon opening the package, an OK flavor once brewed (sort of a nutty strange flavor at first), and once consumed, left an after-taste in my mouth.<br /><br />It is definitely a different roast than I am used to, but it is ""decent"" for a pre-ground Melita decaf.  More of a medium roast as opposed to being a dark bold roast in my opinion.  Overall ... not too bad.<br /><br />I give this coffee a so-so recommendation.",Neutral
"I usually enjoy a cup of coffee a few days a week, more as an indulgence than as a necessity.  It's a sipping beverage for me, and flavor matters a lot.  That said, I add milk and sugar, so I'm not excessively picky (or I think so, at least).  So I'm always glad to find new ""gourmet"" blends to add to my list of favorites.<br /><br />This blend seemed promising, with a very nice aroma and a perfect, even grind.  I usually grind my own beans, but found that this grind worked nicely in my espresso machine as-is.  It even produced a rich, smooth crema.  Unfortunately, my first sip - without sugar or milk - was very bitter.  I ended up adding about a half-teaspoon more sugar than I usually use just to compensate.  Even then, the coffee flavor, itself, was thin and weak.  With just a little milk added, it tasted more like, well, flavored milk.<br /><br />This coffee reminded me of the inoffensive bland coffee my parents used to get for our drip coffee maker a couple of decades ago.  Fine for that application, but not really what I'm looking for in rich, smooth flavor with low bitterness.",Neutral
"This coffee tastes better than Folgers. That's not much of an endorsement, but since Folgers is about all I ever drink, it's my only point of comparison. I would recommend you don't try the stupid and counterproductive experiment of replacing your usual caffeinated stuff with a cup of this some Saturday morning, as doing so will only result in one of those headaches it takes three over-the-counter painkillers to get rid of. And in the meantime, while you're trying to fight off the headache, you'll be completely unable to make headway with that craptastic novel you just got from Amazon, which was reinforcing all your worst opinions of the romantic fantasy subgenre before you had to lie down and commence clutching your forehead.",Neutral
"Normally I would not purchase coffee online as I have several coffee shops within a reasonable distance.  I saw this and figured ""why not?""<br /><br />This coffee was vacuumed sealed and was tight enough to where I had to use scissors to open it.  One thing I tend to avoid is pre-ground coffee.  I usually like to grind my own beans as I find the taste is better.<br /><br />The smell from the bag was for a lack of better words pretty basic.  Usually, there is a distinct smell depending on the bean and there can be faint traces of something.  There wasn't anything distinct about this coffee.<br /><br />I used a standard drip maker which in itself was probably not the best choice but I suspect it would not matter as I was surprised that there really isn't a strong smell coming from the cup of coffee which I drank black.<br /><br />The taste was kind of bland.  I did try a little piece of chocolate and it did seem to help.<br /><br />Overall it's an ok coffee if you are not an aficionado.  However, it's not something I would add to my list of brands I purchase.",Neutral
"I am amazed at the consistent flavor of Melitta coffees. Seriously, I sip any Melitta coffee and can identify it immediately as they all taste the same.

After trying MANY varieties from both the pet store and the grocery store, the Alpo Chicken in Gravy is all he will eat (I can sometimes feed him the T-Bone steak flavor).

My only complaint is that when I received the shipment (pack of 24), almost all of the cans were dented, and a couple had dried gravy on the outside of the can.  One can leaked out - the dent was at the seal on the top.  Normally, I'm not someone who is picky about dented cans, but this was a little much.

"I've suffered from recurrent bouts of acute sinusitis that have only become worse and worse over the years. Every time I get an infection, my right maxillary sinus swells up like a balloon. Sleeping at night on account of this condition is terribly difficult; I often have to resort to using Afrin to decongest my sinuses, which is effective but also very painful and not a realistic, long term solution because of rebound congestion. Now I already irrigate with a motorized system, often upwards of 8-10X daily when I'm sick, and drinking herbal tea has also become a pasttime to help cope with my sinus disease. That being said, I bought this tea out of sheer desperation. I'll try (and have tried) next to anything to give myself some relief while I wait for antibiotics to take effect. The only thing which I find works even close to as well as Afrin is to megadose on Psuedoephedrine (240 1-2 times per day), which is something that is also unsustainable. So, keep in mind that the severity of my sinus condition is drastic. What I found with this tea is that it seems to help, but I can't tell whether or not it works any better than domestic teas that tout similar claims (Yogi's Breathe Deep and Cold Buster, Celestial Sleepytime Sinus Soother, and other respiratory-aiding herbal formulations). I've brewed it double-strong to try and gain the greatest effect, and again, it seems to work modestly but nothing amazing. The taste is a little bitter, but I suppose that's a fairly reasonable indicator it has beneficial compounds in it. All in all, I am likely to stick with the less exotic teas that I can buy at the grocery store. As an aside, I find Celestial's Sweet and Spicy herbal mix to have probably the best mucus thinning effect out of all the teas I've tried, though it's not at all marketed as something for this purpose.

"I gave it 3 stars because of the quality ingredients. But if neither of my cats will eat it, what's the use? We tried weaning them to this food from the junk we've been feeding them by mixing and slowly increasing the amount of Felidae, or by getting them real hungry first, all to no avail. The only way they'll eat it is if we cover it with drippings from fish we cook for ourselves, or from cans of sardines.<br /><br />More than anything, I think the mushy pate type texture bothers them more that the taste, because it smells pretty good to me.",Neutral
"Wonderful ingredients list but the peas are whole. If I don't mush them several of my cats just eat around them.<br />The cats & I all prefer the regular Felidae formula and it's a little cheaper, too.",Neutral
"I was drinking Yuban Organic medium roast coffee until I could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so I tried this instead.  What a let down after drinking the organic coffee.  This just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to Folgers but the organic stuff, now that's a different story. That stuff is good. Tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at Dunn Bros or Caribou coffee houses.  Don't believe me try both this and the organic version side by side.  You won't go back to this again I promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all.",Neutral
"I Wish They Hadn't Changed the Formula for the Yuban that was sold up until about 2 years ago. I even contacted General Foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their ""original"" formula from many years ago. Why? They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isn't what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more.",Neutral
"This pub mix is really a cut above your average snack to be sure.  I tend to pick up a tub of it at the local Walmart here anytime I venture there.  The flavor of it is really hard to pin down.  It's sorta a salty, garlic/onion/whatever type of blend that truly works deliciously.  I'm a self confessed snack-a-holic that has tried just about everything around, and personally I have not tasted anything that is quite like this blend.  It's really good with your favorite beer, or just by itself and I highly recommend it.  The only down side to this stuff is the price.  Which is not something usually cared about or taken into account with UTZ products, which tend to be very reasonably priced for the most part.  Unfortunately like a lot of things that are really good, this mix is not easily found locally.  I see it only at the local Walmart here in the small 20 oz size that carries a hefty price.  I buy it anyway on occasion for its so good, but make no mistake about it, its not cheap as snack chips go.  And unfortunately I do not recommend buying this mix on Amazon in any size.  It's way too expensive here for any deal currently being offered.  If you wanna try it or like it already, I suggest you search it out locally at your big department stores, (it's never found in supermarkets 'round these parts), spring for the price, and grab an ice cold beer and enjoy...",Neutral
"; the problem with this mix -- and to mind, the only problem! -- is the inclusion of one or two slightly sugary little... things. This provides an experience of, well, repugnance, at least for me; I've never been one to mix the sodium and the glucose, and this surely ain't converting me. ESPECIALLY when they're in the same bite/handful. Ugh.<br /><br />Otherwise, this mix is really yummy. It all tastes rather waxy, and I'm sure is not the healthiest food in the world (though you could do worse), but its a well combined mixture.<br /><br />But then again, I've got to sort of work my way through at a crawling pace, because I must grab a handful, and then separate the rejects. Maybe I'm just neurotic, or maybe they made A FATAL MISTAKE AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED.<br /><br />Oh yeah, like the last reviewer, I too got 'em at Costco.",Neutral

"If ever there was a gum to worry about having in your stomach for seven years (as the popular myth states), this one is the most likely. It tastes great, sure, but in the first few bites, it falls apart, losing any cohesiveness (gummyness), and just gets swallowed. For some reason, about 1/3 of it remains intact and becomes gum. What little remains is as the other reviewers state, but knowing that I've swallowed more than half the sticks I've chewed is not a pleasant thought.",Neutral
"Initially, the flavor is fairly accurate, however weak- from there, the flavor diminishes rapidly. I just timed it, and this gum goes flat within 5 minutes.<br />In light of my experience, I find these rave reviews somewhat... amusing; one reviewer even went as far as to describe it as ""incredibly tart"". Meh.<br />Like many new products in the realm of gum, pop, energy drinks, and fast food, they only need you to buy one. If everyone does that, they'll be sitting pretty.<br />Based on this experience, I have no desire to try the other flavors of Extra Dessert Delights.<br />Three stars = It's OK, but doesn't live up to the hype.",Neutral

From now on, I'm going to stick with just pureeing home-cooked food.  It's a lot cheaper, too.",Neutral

"It's got the typical Jif taste, which to me is unremarkable -- it's ... just peanut butter -- however, the single serve containers are convenient and transport well. The consistency is great -- it's not runny yet it's also not a solid hunk-a peanut butter with floating oil either. Good for dipping pretzels or celery/other veggies, and -- in the absence of a spreder -- you can just tear off the top and squuush the contents onto bread.<br /><br />The price is right.",Neutral

"I first came across Lover's Leap Estate tea when buying it from Harney & Sons. I enjoyed that tea very much for its flavorful and clean lightness, reminiscent of an Afternoon Darjeeling. The reason I went with the Elmwood Inn now was that Harney only sells this tea in tins and I wasn't interested in adding a tin to my collection every time I purchased this tea.<br /><br />Of course I cannot be sure that this is exactly the same tea but I must say that the Elmwood Inn fell short of my expectations. It tastes rather uninteresting and almost flat, and in order to get any kind of recognizable flavor, I have to use plenty of leaves. Yet it still never achieves any flavor experience that would justify buying this tea over, lets say, loose Twinings for much less. I will not buy this particular tea again and will continue to search for an equivalent to Harney's Lover's Leap.",Neutral
"Have you ever had a great-cup-of-joe from a freshly opened can of gourmet coffee, only to wonder what happened to that 'fresh' taste as you dig deeper into the can? I have experienced this with other main stream brands but not with 'Yuban Original' coffee! The last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one. There is also a unique quality to this coffee that I have a fondness for. Of course, there will always be something 'better' out there, but it's usually at a higher price. Though the coffee is consistent, it is the wide price range ($0.18 - $0.40 / oz) of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more cautious 3 stars.<br /><br />NOTE:<br />With the ""Subscribe & Save"" option, you can trim costs and be assured of free shipping.

"It's hard to put a *star rating on this.  I like the crackers a whole lot and think they are super.  They are hard to find in our local stores and I use Amazon a lot for good pricing and hard to locate items.  However, this purchase experience was a little disappointing.  The crackers came quickly and in great shape...no breakage and the price was fine.  But, when I opened the first box, I found they had weevils...not a huge infestation but still...once weevils get a foothold, it's all over but the shouting.  I suspect that these boxes have been stored in a southern location as we don't have weevils up here in the north.  Usually they come up in flour and flour products that originate down south.  I found them in southern biscuit flour that I bought at one of the discount grocery stores.  I pop the product in the freezer to kill the weevils and their eggs and then sieve them out...gross, but you can't save money if you toss everything that doesn't meet your approval.  Anyway, can't sieve crackers but I'm still tossing them into the freezer for good measure.  Don't want them to spread to any of my other pantry items.  This review is just a heads up to anyone buying these on Amazon.  Inspect them carefully, pop them in the freezer if in doubt, and enjoy.  The crackers get a 5-star rating; the purchase on Amazon gets a 3 star for warehouse storage.",Neutral

So, my desk at work is now full of Crunchies products, and they are a nice quick snack to keep me going between meals. I recommend them for this purpose, but I think most kids will probably say no to these products given the flavor of the snacks is OK, not great.",Neutral

"Pros:<br />- These are definitely tasty -- especially when taken from the freezer!<br />- Wheat is not one of their ingredients, so they're OK for gluten-sensitive but non-allergic people.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- They contain (less than 2% of) soy (lecithin) which is a state recognized allergen.<br />- They contain canola oil which is one of the least healthy oils on the market, devoid of nutrients and chemically processed.<br /><br />May be a con:<br />- They contain palm oil which unless harvested conscientiously (and more expensively) significantly contributes to the rainforest destruction e.g. in Indonesia. I don't know how Nature Valley's suppliers harvest their palm oil -- hence the separate ""may be a con"" category.",Neutral

They didn't smell super 'vanilla-y' when they arrived, but I can attest that they were soft and pliable-- maybe too pliable and greasy though. Almost immediate of being immersed in it's vodka home, the beans left an oily residue on the top of the glass bottles. The grease has not necessarily gotten worse, but it has some type of oily smell that distracts from the richness of the vanilla. Any one else have this problem?",Neutral
"I received my vanilla beans exactly a month ago today. As soon as I opened the package I LOVED them. They were very moist and I was very pleased at the quality of the beans. I immediately used 18 of the 50+ to make homemade vanilla extract. The beans did not come with storage instructions so I googled it and read that I needed to store them in an airtight container. I've used them a few times over the past month for cooking but I still had over half the package left. Well, when I opened them this evening they were MOLDED. I am so very disappointed that I will be unable to use the rest of my beans. :( If you're able to use all 50 as soon as you get them, then I highly recommend these beans.

I had already given them chicken and they really like it so they are not vegetarians yet anyway.  Mostly I wanted this product for the spinach and the higher iron content.

"I was looking for another dinner to try and decided to spend the extra money on this one.  I thought.. my son loves chicken and mangos so why not this. He is not a fan.

The largest chip was no more than a quarter the size of a whole chip. It was impossible to use them to dip with. I hoped that was just an isolated bag of the product, but, most of the bags had similarly damaged chips. On average there were only a couple of whole chips to each bag.<br />It was very disappointing to have a great slasa style chip reduced to rubble during shipping.

I know my Tubby Toughie would be in cat heaven if they changed the name to ""Fighter Feast"" or ""Beastly Feast"".

This beverage contains a mix of the following juices (reconstituted with sparkling water): apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola. The beverage also includes gum acacia and soy.<br /><br />Despite the fact that there are no added sugars, the calorie and carb counts are quite high - in fact higher than an average soda.

"There are no surprises here. The label promises a perfect blend between juice and carbonation, and that is exactly what Switch delivers: a drink that tastes like carbonated orange juice. Those looking for a healthier alternative to soda will like that Switch contains 100% juice with no added sugar or corn syrup. Those looking for a tasty new carbonated beverage probably won't be impressed.<br /><br />At the time of this writing, Amazon isn't yet stocking Switch so I can't offer an opinion on whether or not I think the price is fair. I wouldn't expect to pay much more than orange juice for this drink, though, since there's nothing really original going on inside the can.",Neutral
"I thought this would have a similar taste to another brand of carbonated juice on the market, called Izze, that has fewer calories, tastes better and costs less. However, Switch has a weird artificial aftertaste. It tastes like a blend between orange juice and orange soda, but not in a good way. Also, with 140 calories per serving (8.3 ounces) and 34 grams of sugar, you might as well drink soda- because this beverage it not any healthier and certainly not cheaper.",Neutral
"If you like the sort of carbonated fruit punch that you get at, e.g., office holiday parties (where alcohol is verboten), you'll probably like The Switch: It does have a nice, ""fruity"" taste (kind of a ""sharp"" orange -- perhaps the tangerine's influence, although probably more the apple juice), with a bit of a bite due to the carbonation.  If this were one of my options at, e.g., the Medusa-esque soda dispensers found at 7-11, I would definitely indulge occasionally and buy some.<br /><br />But an indulgence it is... and that's why I'm not planning on purchasing more from Amazon.  In particular:<br /><br />-- You're paying nearly a buck a can for a little more than a cup of soda.  Please.  I don't mind paying more for higher-quality goods, but at least make it a decent value for the money... make it 12oz.<br />-- Calorically it's not a great value, having around half-again as many calories per once as Coca Cola does.  If you're some teen who can eat whatever you want, this doesn't matter... but for those of us who aren't blessed with such metabolisms... well... the calories are better ""spent"" elsewhere.  The ""no sugar added!"" bit is somewhere between annoying and downright misleading: The ""all natural"" sugar that's coming from the fruit juices is no better nor worse for you than, e.g., regular old cane sugar like better traditional soft drinks have.<br /><br />So, in brief, yes, it is quite tasty, but it's really not a good deal for your pocketbook nor your health unless consumed only on special occasions.<br /><br />P.S. -- My wife tried some as well, and didn't like it as much; she tasted some of the unpleasant ""metallic"" tastes that others here have mentioned.",Neutral

"With all-natural ingredients and mostly real fruit juice, I'm not expecting this drink to taste like soda, punch, or anything like that, but I when I tasted it, I felt myself wanting more. I could really taste the orange-flavor coming though, but they somehow missed me on the tangerine side. Tangerines are very sweet, so I was expecting that to be the predominant flavor, but instead what I tasted was mostly orange, which left a somewhat sour/bitter aftertaste in my mouth. This drink wasn't bad, but given a choice, I'd rather drink orange juice or tangerine juice with seltzer. I don't see how this drink improves beyond that. Switch's other available flavors tasted much better, so in some ways this was a disappointment.",Neutral
"At 22.99 for a pack of 24 cans of Switch orange Tangerine, you're paying about 96 cents per can. Is it worth it? Not really. First of all, you drink juice for health reasons. Vitamins, frutose over corn syrup and the like. Carbonating beverages generally aren't considered good for you, so it's odd that the two would be mixed.<br /><br />Besides the carbonation, and the aluminum can (which has been proved can lead to Alzheimer's) there's a lot of deceptive marketing going on. The can claims that Switch is 100% juice, but it's not actually 100% Orange and Tangerine juice. In fact, the drink is mostly apple and grape juice. You can taste this instantly, along with the metallic tang of being in a can. This is done because both of those juices are quite cheap in comparison to orange and tangerine. So really, you're getting more a a carbonated fruit punch then an orange tangerine drink.<br /><br />You're also gettinbg ""Natural flavours and colours"" which kind of kills the whole ""100% juice"" claim.<br /><br />With a taste that is both metallic and not really resembling the flavours it claims, I can't really recommend this product, You can generally buy boxed 100% juice for less, which contains more flavour, no aluminum and no carbonation.",Neutral
"I didn't really like the taste of this product much.  It has an artificial taste to me, even though it is juice and water.  It is a carbonated drink and it somewhat reminded me of the taste of baby aspirin, although not quite that bad.  I did drink the whole can.  The 8.3 oz can is narrow, compared to the 12 oz soda can you are used to seeing.<br /><br />The can says it is 100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, all natural with no sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and gluten free.  The nutrition box indicates (for the entire 8.3 oz can) 15mg sodium, 36g carbs, 34 g sugar, Vitamin C 100 %, Vitamin A 20%.<br /><br />The ingredients are as follows and are listed in the following order: 100% juice (filtering sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice concentrates), gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascorbic acid (Vitamin C). Contains soy. (First ingredient listed is supposed to be the one there is the most of.)<br /><br />You may wonder why I spent so much time on the ingredients.  Well, if you don't read labels, you really should start.  Some products may taste really good but may be full of nasty things you really do not want your children to eat (or yourself).  The term, gluten free, for example is VERY important to those who have gluten intolerance.<br /><br />Kudos to the manufacturer for making a healthier product and I would have liked to have given this flavor a better review, but the taste was not there for me.  The black cherry flavor has a lot better taste.<br /><br />Still, if you are looking for a seemingly healthier beverage to pack in your child's lunch, this could be worth a try.  Think of it as a flavored carbonated water.  I gave it 3 stars because it is not unhealthy and it is not bad - just not something I like the taste of.<br /><br />I would sooner put this product in a child's lunch than a soda.

However, I've been a long-time drinker of the Tropicana Orange-Tangerine juice and Switch is simply not as good, IMHO.  If I wasn't already a Tropicana drinker, I might be interested in the Switch version of Orange-Tangerine, but I'm not going to ""switch"".  Sorry for the pun.",Neutral
"On the plus side, they get the flavor and carbonation right here.  One fears a Tang taste, but it's more subtle than that and the bubbles are likewise discrete enough that it's no Fizzy-Lifting Drink.<br /><br />On the downside though, one would prefer a sharper after taste to the sort of syrupy way it stays on the tongue.",Neutral
"It's a refreshing drink when served cold. A bit sweet when warm. A little tart, but tolerably so.<br /><br />The flavor is less orange than tangerine, yet I can distinguish several different ""layers"" of citrus in it, including the orange. It's an interesting sensation.<br /><br />I am a little bugged by the fact that an 8.3oz can (2/3rd-size) manages to pack more junk calories in than a full-sized can of cola. It's also supposed to be 100% juice, but reconstituted grape juice is practically pure sugar and there are ""natural flavors"" noted in the ingredients list as well as a soy warning which to me implies some sort of MSG, probably added with the citric acid.<br /><br />So, maybe it's not an especially healthy beverage. It's still tasty and provides a diversion from more typical sodas.",Neutral
"Bottled like an energy drink, Switch, doesn't contain the things you'd find in other carbonated beverages. There's no sugar, no caffeine, no corn syrup, no preservatives or artificial colors.<br /><br />Instead, what you get is a refreshing, all-natural, lightly carbonated tangerine-orange drink loaded with Vitamin C. Think of it as orange soda without all the things you don't want. Switch has just the right amount of carbonation to make the beverage refreshing without being filling.<br /><br />It's a zippy beverage made with real tangerine, apple, and grape juices, and would make a refreshing beverage, lunch, dinner, or snack-time drink.<br /><br />There was a slight aftertaste that I'm chalking up to either the can or the citrus, but it didn't get in the way of enjoying the drink.<br /><br />Make the ""switch"" to Switch.",Neutral
"The biggest argument I have with Switch is that at a hair under $1 for each 8.3 oz can, it's awfully expensive.  I probably could overlook that if Switch was really, really delicious, but frankly it's not.  The orange-tangerine blend lacks the zip and character of those citrus fruits, particularly tangerine and its delicate sweetness.<br /><br />Instead, there's a heavy taste of the apple-grape combination of juices that forms the fruit base.  There's no added sugar, no high fructose corn syrup or any other sweeteners save the apple and grape concentrates, and that's fine, I'd prefer my juice to not have added sweeteners.  In my opinion, juice doesn't need to be sweetened.  I suspect that the fruit concentrate combo is cheaper than making the drink out of pure citrus juice, so I wonder why it's as expensive as it is.<br /><br />What makes me scratch my head is the notation ""Contains soy.""  What?  Why?  Why on earth put soy in a fruit juice cooler?  Honestly, I'd buy some seltzer or carbonated water of some sort and mix it with my own fruit juice before I'd buy Switch.  But if you'd rather have it pre-made, then by all means give it a try.  It's decent enough, just not my glass of juice.",Neutral
"Switch does not taste like carbonated juice.  It tastes like overly sweet orange soda, which may or may not be a positive for you.  The 8.3 ounce can contains 34 grams of sugar.  I did not like the taste, my husband thought it was okay.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 2 is because it does not have any preservatives, added sugars, or high fructose corn syrup.  It does however contain soy, so if you are allergic or concerned about GMO soy, then you may want to avoid this drink.<br /><br />If you are looking for a natural, sweet, carbonated beverage, I would recommend OOBA Hibiscus drink over this.",Neutral
"If you're looking for a healthy alternative to your favorite orange soda, this might be a good choice for you.<br /><br />This is one of the better tasting Switch flavors, although it still tastes a bit like a flat orange Faygo or Slice drink.  It's good, but there's a bit of an aftertaste to watch out for.  It doesn't give you that weird filled up feeling that carbonated beverages seem to have, but if you're looking for some refreshment on a hot summer day (90+ degrees where I live as I write this), I'd stick to tried-and-true Kool-Aid instead.<br /><br />Decent, and a good orange soda alternative, but not life changing.",Neutral
"This is a decent flavored carbonated juice.  It's 100% juice which is good for the more health conscious people.  It tastes pretty good, sweet and a little tangy.  But the flavor does fall short.  Like some reviewers have said, the drink tastes more like a punch than pure orange or tangerine juice.  Do yourself a favor, if you want orange flavored soda, then go for an orange flavored soda.  If you want tangerine, then buy tangerine.  The infusion of both flavors really causes both flavors to fall short slightly short.",Neutral
"Like the SWITCH beverage I previously reviewed, this is a moderately tasty drink.  The balance of the carbonation and the fruit juice is decent enough, giving more of a tickle to the tongue than the rush of bubbles that soda usually gives.  It's definitely a lot more like juice than soda, which goes against its purpose of being a replacement for soda.  Overall, it's pretty drinkable, but I would never seek this beverage out.  There are better juices, and there are better sodas.<br /><br />One major plus, though, was that it wasn't as thick and syrupy as the Watermelon/Strawberry SWITCH.<br /><br />6/10",Neutral
"I really didn't think there was anything special about this product. It doesn't have a bad taste, but it is different than a regular orange flavored soda. It is definitely not as sweet (which isn't a bad thing for me as I find the orange sodas way too sweet) and left a tiny bit of an odd aftertaste. It is a healthier alternative to regular sodas as there is no high fructose corn syrup, but it was still just as caloric. It is juice rather than artificial syrups, but the first juices listed in the ingredients are the overly sweet apple and grape constitutes, not orange and tangerine, to make the drink taste sweeter I suppose. Honestly, considering the price of this product and the lukewarm impression it left on me, I would rather just pour my own juice blend and add soda water or sparkling water to it myself. Most juices seem to be vitamin C fortified themselves, so unless you are just looking to replace the artificial sodas with something less damaging, I can't see a big benefit to this product.",Neutral
"I thought I would like this more than I do. Maybe it's my palate, but my first taste impression was pineapple, not orange or tangerine. The small portion size may be acceptable for an energy drink, but is not what I would call thirst-quenching. Not a good choice for anyone trying to control calories or carbs. On the plus side, it is sweet, but not too sweet and the level of carbonation is well-balanced.",Neutral
"I don't like how so many bottled and canned drinks these days (even the low-calorie ones) are so sweet.  This was nicely not-too-sweet, but had a canned, not fresh juice flavor.  It is personal taste, but I didn't care for the 'processed' flavor.",Neutral
"I'm not a big fan of carbonated juices, but am a huge lover of orange/tangerine.  In that respect, this was a disappointment for me, not being as tangeriny enough for me.  The first sip left me with an extremely unpleasant aftertaste, but had gotten easier to tolerate with additional sips.  But, after waiting a while for another sip, that initial unpleasantness returned.  If I'm going to drink juice, I'll stick to what I prefer, uncarbonated.",Neutral
"Looks can be deceiving, especially with this product:  The cute, tiny can looks great, but don't fall for it!  This little guy packs an amazing 140 calories per 8.3 oz can.  My favorite 24 oz Arizona Iced Tea(black/white tea with sugar) has almost just as many calories(150) and almost 3 times the size of Switch.  Also, do not be tempted with ""100% Vitamin C and 20% Vitamin E"" pitch either.  Most of us consume 100% of daily Vitamin C without even trying through foods and anything extra get eliminated.<br /><br />The taste however does feel a bit more natural than other artificial orange sodas though, so that's the only plus.  Also, if you do not worry about gaining weight, I guess this is a good way to get a sugar rush in a tiny can.<br /><br />Overall, a good-tasting product, but there are many other low-caloric alternatives out there.  A can of Diet Coke and a multivitamin anyone?",Neutral
"When I tried a can of Switch Orange Tangerine I was expecting to taste something similar to Orange Crush or Sunkist soda.  Switch is actually quite different.<br /><br />Switch claims that it doesn't add any extra sugar or common additives found in most mainstream sodas.  And when you taste it, I believe them.  Since it doesn't have the added refined sugar of an Orange Crush-type soda, Switch comes across with a subtly harsher, more acidic taste. This can of Switch tastes like...well...carbonated orange juice.  To me, this is a good thing.  I enjoyed the flavor and found it tasty and pleasantly unique.<br /><br />Given all that, I would absolutely buy this product all of the time if it wasn't for the unfortunate price.  These cans are only 8.3 ounces and cost close to $1 per can.  That's a heck of a lot more than the $0.25-$0.33 you pay for a 12 ounce can of mainstream soda (when purchased as a typical 12 or 24 pack).<br /><br />I love the taste of this stuff, I love that it doesn't have all kinds of extra refined sugar, and I hate the price.  I want to buy it, but I just can't afford it and have to drop it to 3-stars on that merit alone.  Too bad.",Neutral
"The Switch Orange Tangerine soda is an attempt to made a fruit soda with real fruit juice, real fruit flavor, and no added sugar.  They have mostly succeeded.  In the glass, the Switch looks like juice.  It is lightly but distinctly carbonated and easy to drink.  The orange and tangerine flavors are true - none of the ""burn"" of fake orange flavor.  The hit of tangerine is really nice and I greatly enjoyed the flavor.  My problem with the Switch was that it was too sweet for my taste.  I was surprised at the how sweet it was given the advertised ""no added sugar"".  The ingredient list mentions grape and apple juice concentrates.  That's how they get the sugars in without adding sugar.  Fruit juice concentrates are loaded with natural fruit sugars.  The nutritional label tells the story:  the 8.3 oz can has 34 grams of sugar!  That's more than Cocoa Cola (27 grams per 8 oz).  Bottom line - this is just too sweet for me.  It's too bad because the flavors are awesome.  If you have a sweet tooth, maybe this is for you.",Neutral
"This drink is ok. A little pricier with several more calories and carbs than I would like, but it is a good alternative to soda. I am glad there's no artificial sweetener in it.

"I'm always looking for a carbonated alternative to sodas so I thought I'd give this a try. Generally I enjoy drinking naturally flavored sparkling water like La Croix or Crystal Geyser. I also very much enjoy Izzy's sparkling water/juice blends. Unlike Izzy, which combines juice and water, this is a 100% juice beverage that is carbonated. I have to say, it is definitely full of flavor, but it's just too sweet tasting. I like a bit of orange juice now and then, but for this type of carbonated drink, I'm just not into all that sweetness. I tried diluting it with some sparkling water, but the flavor just wasn't quite what I wanted. I like that Izzy is just a bit on the tart side with it's flavors. This is a nice idea and it's pretty ok. I just prefer other beverages over this one.",Neutral
"I just tried the Orange tangerine version of The Switched carbonated drink and overall I like it.  It tastes very similar to mandarin orange Slice but it uses natural juices and no HFCS.  If you are very concerned about artificial flavors and HCFS, but still want a carbonated drink, then Switched may be a good alternative.  I read the ingrediants list and it mainly included reconstituted juces and then aboiut another line of preservatives and additives, I would assume similar to those in commercial fruit juices.<br /><br />Personally, I am more concerned about overall sugar and calories in my soft drinks so this little 8 oz can has 140 calories and 34 grams of sugar.  If memory serves me that is in line with the calories of most softdrinks and more sugar then most soft drinks.<br /><br />Ultimately, i think this is a good tasing product, but the touted benefits doesn't outweigh the increased price and availability conpared to regualar soda.  I guess the key is still moderation.",Neutral
"I wasn't sure what to expect from a carbonated fruit drink, but decided to give it a try.  While it was drinkable, I actually prefer the natural taste of fruit juice.  This actually tasted like an artificial soda, much like a very well known orange soda.  The carbonation was excessively strong, with too much bite and burn for my liking.<br /><br />As some other reviewers pointed out, the amount of sugar and calories in this drink was astounding.  It is almost too sweet, and combined with the carbonation was just too much for me to enjoy it very much.",Neutral
"This one tasted pretty good.  Very tangy, but in a 'real fruit' kind of way.  I think they got this one right.  I still can't ever see myself buying a bunch of this.  Maybe if amazon sent me more than a single can to try, I would have build a habbit of drinking them (cough..hint..cough).<br /><br />I don't really understand any drink this size.  If I were thirsty at all, I would want way more, at least 12 oz.  The only other drinks this size are those crazy energy drinks, and those are obviously more of a 'means to an end' kind of drink.  I guess it is supposed to be more of a gourmet soda/juice.  I guess there is a market for that, I'm just not part of it.<br /><br />Nice little carbonated juice, but still not really worth the effort/money for me.",Neutral
"Switch has ""100% of what you want"" and ""0% of what you don't,""  according to the can.  Also, according to the can it is ""100% juice.""  According to the Amazon product page it contains soy.

"At first, I really wanted to like this drink. ""The Switch"" tasted like tangerines and had a good aroma. The drink is carbonated, but not really strongly so. It is pleasant. However, after a few seconds, an after taste developed that was a little bitter. My wife thought this after taste was even a little ""off"", but she has a more sensitive palate than I do. In any case, the net effect was that I would just as soon have Orangina, and I won't be going out to buy more of ""The Switch"" Orange Tangerine. On the other hand, if this is what was being served at a party or gathering with few or no other choices, I wouldn't avoid it either.",Neutral
"I love juice and I love carbonated beverages, but it is difficult to see this product having a long retail life.<br /><br />Essentially, this is a good drink that doesn't really do anything well.<br /><br />It doesn't taste good enough to be a juice replacement--and is there really a need for a juice replacement?  It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.<br /><br />It's not exactly a post-workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesn't add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, it's less healthy than most juices.<br /><br />Switch isn't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.<br /><br />As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit-based sodas.  And, $22 a case, it's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans.<br /><br />So, in the end, Switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy.",Neutral
"Ive tried the Black Cherry version of this drink, and I prefer that to this. Both are light and refreshing and WAY better than fruit-flavored waters. YUK! You can tell by the taste these are definitely fruit juices but without the sticky, thick, sweetness of a non-carbonated drink. This orange tangerine flavor though - there's this weird taste to it one that hits you immediately. Not quite bitter, not quite metallic, but definitely not yummy - unless you like bitter fruit - not sour - bitter. Maybe it's too much carbonation for my taste. If you've tried the other flavors and are looking to try something new - think twice about this one. It is tingly and refreshing, but I won't order it again.",Neutral
"I didn't mind the taste of this very much - it tasted like Minute Maid OJ mixed with soda.  My husband couldn't stand it at all.  My only issue with this was that it was a heavy-syrup sort of flavor that was a little overwhelming.  If there was a better balance of flavor to liquid to make it a little lighter tasting, I think this would be much more refreshing and enjoyable.  Might be fine for kids though - since they like that sugary orange stuff.",Neutral

"My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me a bit of the soda ""Orange Crush,"" although nowhere near as carbonated. Unlike ""Orange Crush,"" this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz that your typical sodas have, and a very pleasant surprise was the fact that I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and you could swear that you just swallowed a week old dead skunk tail first. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 140 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a fairly good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative and would probably keep me from purchasing this product.<br /><br />If they created a 12 ounce can and lowered the price, then I would be more apt to purchase it.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence series.",Neutral
"The Switch bills itself as ""great tasting healthy alternative to soda"" so I decided to see for myself. The first thing I wanted to do was compare it's nutritional facts against my favorite orange soda and this is how they matched up:<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine (Per Serving)<br />16.97 Calories<br />1.8 mg Sodium<br />4.3 g Carb<br />4.1 g Sugar<br />20% RDA Vitamin A<br />100% RDA Vitamin C<br /><br />National Brand Orange Soda (Per Serving)<br />15.8 Calories<br />3.7 mg Sodium<br />4.3 g Carb<br />4.3 g Sugar<br /><br />Besides slightly less sodium, the addition of vitamins and no added sugars <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG945O"">The Switch Orange Tangerine, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> didn't really stand out as a winner based on nutritional facts alone. So when it came to drinking it, I had expected to prefer the more natural taste that The Switch might offer.  Unfortunately the main two juices used in this drink are Apple and Grape and that left me not tasting the ""Orange Tangerine"" as much as I had wanted.<br /><br />Overall when comparing the two beverages not only did it not impress me with taste or nutrition, but add on the obvious price difference ($.03 per ounce vs. $.11 per ounce) and The Switch won't be causing me to switch. I'm happy to stick with my good old orange soda.",Neutral
"I tried this product after Switch's Watermelon-Strawberry drink, and while I thought that drink was decent, I was not a big fan of the Orange-Tangerine flavor.  The taste was an obvious blend of a number of different flavors in addition to orange and tangerine, and for me that made it taste more Orange-ish than Orange.  As others have noted, the amount of calories and sugar are not that different from a cola, so it's not really clear that it's THAT much healthier than other sodas.<br /><br />Personally though, I'd rather just grab a glass of orange juice or eat an orange instead.  I guess it depends on what you are deciding to ""switch"" from: for people looking for an alternative to cola, I guess this might be an attractive product.  But as someone who prefers water or tea and rarely drinks sodas, this product isn't close to making me want to ""switch"".",Neutral
"If you like a little fizz with your juice this is a good product.  Tasty and refreshing.  However, like all juice it is not low in calories, so don't buy it expecting it to be more like a low cal fruit flavored sport drink.",Neutral
"For a beverage that is basically 100% fruit juice that has been carbonated, with no sweetners or preservatives added, Switch Orange Tangerine pretty much tasted to me like a can of Orange Crush or Sunkist soda.<br /><br />That isn't a bad thing, per se...but it was not something I would pay a premium for if I were in the mood for orange soda.  Presumably, it is a little bit healthier than a straight soda, but it is nothing special to taste, and thus I will not go through the effort to seek it out.<br /><br />(On the other hand, my 16 year old daughter claimed to like it MORE than orange soda, and in fact said that she felt she could taste the grape juice in it.  As with many juices, even though it is orange ""flavored""...grape juice is a major ingredient.  So she would give it four stars.)",Neutral
"The Switch Orange/Tangerine gets kudos from me for not including added sugars and nasty ingredients found in some traditional sodas, but as for flavor, it leaves something to be desired.  The initial yummy tangerine flavor of the drink is great, but after a few swallows, a strange after-taste invaded my mouth.  I found it difficult to drink the whole can.",Neutral
My 7 year old daughter thought it was good tasted like pop but only drank 1/2 of the can. I thought it tasted like watered down orange soda with very little fizz with funny after taste. It is suppose to be  100% juice with vitamin C that has been carbonated. Ok here is my thought either buy 100% orange juice that taste like it came right of the tree or buy a orange pop. For me this product won't be flying off the shelves.,Neutral
"I really liked the taste of both this and one other flavor that we were able to order.  So I went on line to see what kind of pricing there was on it.  At only 8.3 oz. for about a dollar, that's roughly the equivalent of $1.50 for a single can if it was a full 12 oz. soft drink.  Our budget isn't going to justify ongoing purchases of this product.  If we had more discretionary money, we might do it, but it'd be more of a treat than a regularly used product (partly because of the small size).  So the taste was at least 4-stars, but the price brought it down considerably - even recognizing the fact that the ingredients are far better than what is in most other soft drinks.",Neutral
"This orange soda is clearly more healthful, and it tastes tangier, although somewhat less sweet, than other orange sodas.  The one big drawback for me was that this drink lacks caffeine.",Neutral
"I want to start this review by stating that this is not the perfect balance between juice and carbonated drink I've ever had.  That said this is certainly a good alternative for those who love carbonated drinks but don't like some of the ingredients.  Switch has attempted to address this concern and I feel it's a step in the right direct.  This is an Orange Tangerine flavored juice that is carbonated but without added sugar, preservatives, corn syrup, or caffeine.  In other words this is about as natural as you can get without, you know, drinking real orange juice.<br /><br />The can is also thinner then a soda can so you're not getting as much liquid as you would a Pepsi or Coke.  This means there is less fat in each can, and the makers claim the product is glutton free.  It does have a bit of a weird aftertaste, but after a few sips it stops bothering you.  While not a perfect drink it's one I enjoyed and will likely pick up again in the future.",Neutral
"I chuckled a little when I read that this soda had no added sugar when I checked the label in the can since it already has 34gms of sugar anything more added and you'll have sugar junkies of whoever tries the drink.  The soda is tasty and quite fizzy, I think it has more carbonation than Fanta which goes flat easier.  The can is the typical size of an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink merely another fruit flavored soda.  It is flavored naturally, but that is the only difference from regular soda type drinks.",Neutral
"According to the side of the can, it's 100% juice with a balance on the carbonation. It tastes great if not for the chalky aftertaste. The low carbonation made it feel less of a soda and more of a juice. I probably wouldn't buy it in the store because of the weird taste.",Neutral
"This carbonated product has a nice natural juice taste to it that makes you feel like you're drinking something that might be a little healthier than all the other carbonated stuff out there on the shelves but I couldn't help but notice the amount of sugar this thing has listed on the nutrition facts:<br /><br />34g per 8.3 oz can of the stuff. 36g total carbs.<br /><br />Like I said, it's good but don't get fooled into thinking its any healthier for you. There's no artificial stuff in here according to the can at least.",Neutral
"This product claims to be a healthy carbonated product. This particular flavor is very heavy on the orange taste (which is to be expected). As a matter of fact, I found it very close to normal orange soda.<br /><br />Here are the claims of the product from the label:<br /><br />100% juice, 100% RDA Vitamin C, All Natural, Carbonated, Great Taste and Refreshment.<br /><br />No Sugar Added, No Corn Syrup, No Preservatives, No Artificial Colors, Gluten Free<br /><br />Nutritional Information:<br /><br />Serving Size 8.3 Fl. Oz.

Contains Soy.<br /><br />Compared to soda, it is healthier in that it doesn't contain added sugars or corn syrup.  But it still has a bunch of calories.  Eating fruits whole is better than juice, but if you want a quick soda-like pick me up (and you love orange soda), I would recommend this product over regular soda.<br /><br />I gave this product 3 stars because I don't think it really is that healthy, but is a decent alternative to regular soda. Also, the taste was ok, nothing remarkable.",Neutral
"The SWITCH ORANGE TANGERINE SODA doesn't taste too bad and it is carbonated, but the taste reminded me of orange juice that went sour. You know, when the O.J. has gone way past the expiration date and you gulp some and it has that bitter acidic taste.<br /><br />Anyway, the soda is made from a combination of apple, grape, tangerine, orange and acerola juice, and doesn't add sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or artificial colors. It's also gluten free so that's good news for those who are trying to watch what they eat and drink.<br /><br />The 8.3-ounce can is smaller than the standard 12-ounce can of soda and maybe it just takes a couple of tries to get used to the flavor.<br /><br />Like I said, not bad but I'll stick with regular/diet soda. But for a healthier alternative for soda lovers, I suggest trying one of the ""SWITCH SODAS"" OR any naturally flavored sparkling water.",Neutral
"Sometimes if too many flavors are mixed together, the result tastes like none of them.  This doesn't taste like orange or tangerine.  It tastes, to me at least, very sweet and sort of orangy but not tart at all, and I like my citrus type sodas to be tart and sort of sour.<br /><br />Still, great for those who are trying to get away from the high fructose corn syrup diet.",Neutral
"I was really looking forward to sampling this product. It's not bad, but a little too sweet-tasting for me. Also, at 140 calories for an 8.3 oz can, I thought that was on the high end. But it does contain 34 grams of sugar, and one must remember that fruit juice is not low in calories. I would have preferred more sparkling water and less juice. On the plus side, it has no artificial ingredients or colors. And no corn syrup! I am sure many will like this product more than I, especially those who prefer more sweetness in their beverages.",Neutral
"This 8.3 ounce can of carbonated beverage is tangy and tasty. And the slimmer size can means that you are drinking a smaller serving than an ordinary can of soda. But although it's 100% juice, it still packs quite the calorie punch. One can is 140 calories, which is almost exactly the same as in a 12 oz. can of regular Coca-Cola! So it may be slightly healthier than drinking Coke since it has no caffeine or high-fructose corn syrup and it has 100% of your requirement of Vitamin C. But it's not going to make you as slim and attractive as the packaging!",Neutral
"This product is not a soda but a carbonated juice. This soda has a nice taste- its not as sweet and as pure orange-tasting as typical orange soda-like drinks. It's not pure orange juice- but made up of a mixture of several different juices including apple, orange, grape and tangerine.  That juice blend gives it a slightly tangy taste that is actually at first slightly surprising and mostly refreshing.  The carbonation also seems lighter to me than soda but it is definitely there.<br /><br />The things I like about this product are the smaller can size (8.3oz)which makes it a more appropriate serving that a regular soda.  I also like the bright packaging and the pleasant taste.  After reading the ingredients of SWITCH carefully- I see that it is all juice just as it claims- so its probably a better choice than a regular soda.<br /><br />This product has no added sugars just as advertised on the can- but buyer beware- its still kind of high in sugar because fruit juices are naturally high in sugar. As always be sure to read the label if you are concerned about sugar levels.<br /><br />Overall I think this product is a good size and has a pleasant taste- especially if you are looking for something that tastes like an orange juice blend.  Traditional orange soda fans might be slightly disappointed in the taste.",Neutral
"I liked the level of carbonation.  It was actually more highly carbonated than I was expecting, but didn't taste dry the way I would expect an artificial-sugar-free drink to taste with carbonation added.  I was hoping it would taste more ""orangey,"" but the tangerine is the more dominant flavor (along with apple, a common juice ""filler"").  Despite having ""no added sugar,"" however, there is still 34 grams worth of it in the small 8.3oz can.  Basically, other than having 100% of the daily value of Vitamin C, this drink could easily be replaced with a better tasting orange soda that is in a 12oz can and costs far less.  Unless you really like the taste, or you want to ensure your Vitamin C beverage stays fresh longer, I'd give this one a pass.",Neutral
"The logo on the can states ""0% of what you don't want..."" but that's not quite true. It's quite tasty, but loaded with calories.<br /><br />Next time, they need to leave out the sugar as well.<br /><br />Also, this drink isn't readily available.",Neutral
"This drink tastes just like soda to me. Very strong and sweetened soda. It reminds me a lot of Fanta back in the day (1970s). I know it says it has all these vitamins and that it's healthy, but the flavor and amount of calories would keep me from buying this drink as a ""health drink"". There are plenty of vitamin and flavored waters and sports drinks that would serve the same purpose without all those calories. If I want a soda, I certainly wouldn't pay a lot of money for something that tastes just like it but costs 4 times as much (at a guess). I do love the taste of Fanta, though.",Neutral
"Note: This is my first review of a product that is not a book, so please forgive me if I miss something.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of fruit drinks like The Switch, but I decided to go ahead and give it a shot. After having my first drink, I can honestly say I wanted to hate it. I mean, seriously, I'm drinking this can of 100% fruit juice with carbonation and reading all these really stupid quotes all over the can (i.e. ""100% of what I want in a soda, 0% of what I don't""), wondering how much a 8.3 ounce can of this junk costs (thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of $2.50 or $3.00; and thinking, if I wanted to drink some juice and would drink some juice! I couldn't stop thinking about what is so special about carbonation that I would want to drink this over a glass of OJ. I wanted to scream!<br /><br />However, I kept my cool, and finished the drink. There was something about this particular flavor that was enjoyable, but not engrossing. There was something in the aftertaste that I did not like, and I think it had to do with the tangerine juice. Tangerine's aren't my bag, either; but it was tolerable.<br /><br />After discussing this product with my wife (I know, this drink apparently also contains the conversation starter attributes, bonus points for that I suppose) she was like, ""this sounds great. Is it like those <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IW25RK"">Izze POMEGRANATE SPARKLING 100% JUICE DRINK</a>??"" I responded: ""Um.... I guess so...""<br /><br />I then also looked up the price and learned that I had grossly overestimated the price of a single can (being just over a single dollar). Despite my wanting to hate this product, I've decided to step out of my anti-contemporary culture box, view this product for what it is, and give it a middle rating of 3 stars.<br /><br />I can see the attraction; I can see the appeal; I just won't ever buy it. I'll stick to my glass of Orange Juice and Tang any day.<br /><br />Good drinking,<br /><br />J.Stoner",Neutral
"You know what one of my favorite sounds is? The sound of a can opening. I think it's weird, consider I'm not a huge soda drinker...since I find most sodas too be way too sweet or sugary.<br /><br />This is a review for an Orange Tangerine drink from Switch. I've never heard of them, but I was feeling kind of thirsty so I ordered a can from the vine program. It's an 8.3 ounce can of 100% carbonated juice (plus gum acacia, natural flavors and colors, ascborbic acid and soy). I don't know what to think about some of the ingredients, but I certainly do know that I like: that it's only 8 ounces and that it has no corn syrup!<br /><br />It tastes very similar to canned Minute Maid drinks, especially the Vallencia Orange offering...but does have a slightly sickly sweet aftertaste.  I don't know if I'd run out and buy a 24 pack, but if I saw this in a restaurant I'd definitely consider it as a tasty complement to a sandwich and potato chip lunch.<br /><br />The last thing I like is about the company: it seems to be an independently owned shop, and I like that.",Neutral
"100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't is proudly emblazoned upon the can that contains Switch's Orange Tangerine carbonated juice. It certainly tasted all-natural, as there wasn't too much taste really.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it was all right, but I would say it tasted kind of like Sprite with a couple of orange flavored Alka-Seltzers tossed in. Another note is that it is rather small at only just over 8 ounces. However, it still had enough orange taste I suppose, so if you want an all-natural mild orange flavored carbonated juice drink, then you've just hit the jack-pot!<br /><br />If not, you may want to pass this up, mildly recommended.",Neutral
"One of my favorite but rare indulgences is a can of orange soda; so I was looking forward to the combination of bubbles and orange flavor when I popped open my can of Switch Orange Tangerine. To my disappointment, it tasted more like fruit punch, perhaps because of the apple and grape juices in it to sweeten it. I would say the makers of this drink went overboard on the apple-grape combo, not just in the flavor department, but in the sweetness. It's sticky icky sweet, more than any of the cheaper brands (Sunkist, Crush and others) of orange soda, or the higher priced goodies like Orangina and the delectable Izze.<br /><br />It is fairly healthy however, with no bad stuff and quite a lot of Vitamin C (100% based on 2,000 calorie intake), All Natural, etc. My recommendation is for more orange, less apple/grape, or change the label flavor to ""mixed fruit."" It's 140 calories per cute little 8.3 oz can, and if you're not expecting orange you may like it. So far, the taste winner for cute little cans for me is Izze's Grapefruit, which has the perfect balance of flavor and carbonation, with the right amount of sweetness.",Neutral
"The drink is 100% juice concentrate reconstituted with carbonated water.  It tastes like a cross between <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GN4OHK"">Orangina Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Natural Pulp - 24 Cans</a> and the orange drink from McDonalds.<br /><br />It was refreshing at first, but the aftertaste is abrupt and almost chemically.  It's odd, because the drink doesn't have any unnatural flavors, according to the ingredients list.  If the end flavor was more natural, I would definitely buy it again.",Neutral
"The Switch Orange Tangerine presents  an alternative to ordinary soft drinks, offering one- hundred percent of what you want in a drink and zero percent of what you don't want; or so the manufacturer claims. This is a newer brand of beverage and it follows a trend toward healthier alternatives for every day foods and drinks- a trend that has been gaining steam as more and more individuals look for ways to improve their health.<br /><br />This beverage offers a taste that is refreshing, but slightly different than what I expected. Yes, you get to experience the taste of juicy oranges and tangerines, but there are other flavors present as well and I couldn't quite put my finger on these other flavors until I read the ingredients and discovered that The Switch Orange Tangerine is also made with apple and grape juices. The grape is barely noticeable, but the apple can be detected and it, along with added soy, is responsible for the interesting taste sensation that you experience in the aftertaste.<br /><br />The Switch Orange Tangerine is billed as a health drink and it does, indeed, have many positive selling points in terms of composition and nutrition. There is no added sugar, no artificial colors, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. The beverage is also gluten- free and provides one- hundred percent of the USRDA for Vitamin C and twenty percent of the USRDA for Vitamin A. There is no fat and no protein, either. But there are thirty- four grams of sugars and a fairly high level of calories. Granted, these are natural sugars but thirty- four grams is still a large amount and it won't be acceptable to those on low carb diets.  And with almost seventeen calories per ounce, the caloric content is higher than that of most soft drinks.<br /><br />So, are there enough reasons to make the switch to The Switch Orange Tangerine? My answer is yes, due to both its good, refreshing taste and its better than average nutritional content. It isn't the greatest tasting orange beverage I have ever tried and it is more expensive than most other drinks, including regular orange juice. But it does have enough positive points to earn it a recommendation.",Neutral
"Sorry, but I just don't ""get it"".  You pay almost a buck for 8.3oz (just over a cup) of carbonated water and fruit juice concentrate.  FYI, the first one listed on the can is Apple. . . then Grape. . . then Tangerine. . . then Orange.  The taste is fine, but personally, I would much rather have a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. .  .for a lot less $$. The can is small and cylindrical, like an energy drink, but there's nothing in this to give you a ""boost"".  FYI, there are 140 calories in one can.  If you have the $$ to spend, then yes, it's a tasty beverage.  But it's simply not a good value in my book.",Neutral
"The Switch Orange Tangerine drink is one of the many beverages out there that are trying to offer soda drinkers a slightly healthier alternative without sacrificing the flavor.  No mistake should be made to think that Switch is primarily a fruit drink.  Although it contains 100% juice, Switch is a soda first and a fruit beverage second.  The carbonation, combined with the various citrus flavors, make Switch taste a bit like Mountain Dew with an extra orange kick.<br /><br />Soda fans who like Mountain Dew but want something made of juice should love Switch, as it does offer a slightly healthier alternative to the standard carbonated drink.  Since there are so many fruit juices present each can has 100% of the daily recommended Vitamin C and 20% of the daily recommended vitamin A.  The lack of artificial preservatives does also give it a slightly more crisp taste.<br /><br />It's important to note that Switch isn't ""sugar free,"" but rather has ""no sugar added.""  The distinction is missed by many, and could be very important for diabetics or anyone watching their sugar intake.  The drink actually has 34 grams of sugar in each can, but since it's coming from the fruit juice and not from high fructose corn syrup it's less of a problem for anyone looking for a more healthy drink.<br /><br />The biggest factor in deciding if Switch will be worthy anyone's time depends entirely on how much they enjoy carbonated citrus drinks.  Soda fans who want a fruitier and less artificial drink will probably love Switch.  People who just want fruit juice and don't enjoy the carbonated flavor should probably avoid, however.",Neutral
"In fact, I did not like the artificial taste in this orange drink. The degree of carbonation is alright and it does have an ""orangey"" taste to it. But I cannot ignore the artificial taste that accompanies this beverage. For now, I would stick with plain orange juice or other orange sodas like ""Crush"".",Neutral
As the title of my review indicates this product is nothing special in terms of taste. Granted it is missing some of the soda pop bad guys (high fructose syrup and coloring)but the taste is mediocre. This is not something you are going to rave about because of the taste. If you are a health food junkie you might overlook the bland middle of the road taste. Contrary to some reviews I did not find the drink exceptionally sweet but than again everyone has different taste buds. I am not a soda pop drinker so that might have some influence on my less than enthusiastic endorsement. I was switched off. Will this make you give up your favorite soda pop? Probably not. I like the idea of homemade soda water infused juice for that perky fizzing drink better than Switch. Not such a great product in my opinion.,Neutral
"There are things that I recall from my childhood that I would rather not - being stung by a bee, chicken pox, all the attempts to learn to ride a bike before I actually learned to ride it, and Tang.  Tang was that chalky, never quite dissolved in the water, powdered drink that schools and company picnics would try to pawn off on kids as Kool-aid.  It wasn't Kool-Aid by any stretch of the imagination - it was Tang.  I've never heard anyone ASK for Tang... it was just what was there.<br /><br />So I get my can of Switch in the mail, eyeball the can... it's the same size and shape as an energy drink can... one of those ""single shot"" type cans.  Fearing that it was an energy drink I checked the label... says it's pretty much all juice, carbonation, and some natural flavors (including soy?!?) so I pop it open and take a swig.<br /><br />Now it MAY be 100% natural juices with some natural flavoring - but I know Tang when I taste it.  This is carbonated Tang... I know it is.  Somewhere out there is a giant warehouse filled with cannisters of powdered Tang and someone thought to themselves - what do we do with all of this stuff?  I know, mix it with carbonated water and voila! Now it's not Tang, it's Switch!<br /><br />In all honesty there are probably people out there who will love this drink - but for the price they are asking and the small size of the can - I would suggest whipping up your own Tang with fizzy water.<br /><br />Pros- Pretty much all natural - Juices, natural flavors and no unnatural dyes (good for the ADHD kids).<br /><br />Cons- I personally didn't care at all for the taste, a bit overpriced for what you are actually getting, can will trick many into believing they are buying an energy drink.",Neutral
"Overall the drink was decent. It's tart and sweet at the same time. Switch is alright but might not be worth the money depending on how much you like it. I myself would prefer a Spicy V8 over this. It might be a good substitute for some who don't want to drink as much soda, but for me i'll just stick with the v8 and the occasional soda.",Neutral
This product has a nice smooth taste with the additional tanginess of tangerine.<br />It also has a little bit of a sweetness to it but syrupy sweet.<br />Not lingering or noticeable aftertaste.,Neutral
"When I first glanced at this item, my first thought was a Nehi orange-type soft drink.  However, it is made of 100% fruit juice with carbonation added.  It tastes way too sweet for my taste buds, much more than regular OJ.  In fact, it left an aftertaste in my mouth and I had to brush my teeth right after taste-testing it.<br /><br />I ended up mixing the rest with a shot of vodka and it made a great screwdriver with a kick of carbonation.",Neutral
"I enjoyed the product very much.  I like that it is not overly sweet or heavy.  There is no aftertaste and it goes down smoothly with just enough carbonation to give it body.<br /><br />The tangerine/orange taste I found to be clean.  If you like something that is sweeter, this might not be for you.  But if you enjoy the fruity taste with some carbonation it is quite nice.  I drank it chilled.  I don't think I would have enjoyed it at room temperature.<br /><br />The price might keep me away.  Almost a dollar per 8oz can is kind of tough.<br /><br />Four stars for taste and two stars for price = three stars.",Neutral
"Switch markets itself as an alternative to soda.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice with no added sweeteners.  I do agree that if you are a person who drinks a lot of soda or have  child who does, switching to his would be the better alternative.<br />BUT - this drink is not healthy by any means, the amount of fruit juice required for it's tastiness results in a HIGH sugar and calorie content for a fruit juice.  You would not want to drink 5 of these in a day and the better option would be a piece of fruit with less calories and sugar.",Neutral
"This soda sounded like a good idea, but it is just too sweet. The orange and tangerine juice is clear and bitter tangy but the sugar in this particular flavor is overwhelming to me. (On the other hand I liked the cherry very much.) I would drink it anyway, if it were offered, it certainly is not terrible. But I would not buy it again.",Neutral
"I really enjoyed the Switch.  It was a lot more carbonated than most sodas and stayed that way until I finished it.  I was also surprised that no sugar was added since it was sweet and had real crisp, tangerine taste.  It was similar to Sunkist pop but it tasted more like real juice.  I enjoyed the taste and if you have the extra money and want a healthier alternative, you might want to give it a try, but it is still 140 calories per can.  So it isn't exactly a diet drink.  And the price for the Switch is about 4 times the cost of most soft drinks so I think it would be out of the range for most people's pockets.",Neutral
"""Switch `Orange Tangerine'"" is advertized as 100% juice with carbonation.  They were accurate as far as the 100% juice and (light) carbonation goes, but imagine my disappointment when I checked the ingredients, and I read the following: ""100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, tangerine, orange, and acerola juice concentrates)...<br /><br />BTW - acerola is also known by the common names Barbados cherry and wild crapemyrtle. It's a berry that has extremely high amounts of Vit C.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the drink.  When I ordered this item I was expecting a carbonated ""orange tangerine"" drink, but that was not the taste I got.  After all, tangerine and orange are present in smaller amounts than grape and apple juices.  As a result this drink had a flavor more like a mixture of sparkling grape and sparking apple combined, with somewhat of a light citrus twist, but less carbonation than either sparkling grape or sparkling apple have.<br /><br />The overall flavor of ""Switch"" was all right, but it was not, in my opinion ""orange tangerine"" at all.  In that respect this drink was a great disappointment.  The manufacturer would have been more accurate to name this drink ""fruit punch"" or ""fruit cocktail"" or perhaps ""grape-apple"".  There is, by the way, already a ""fruit punch"" version...I wonder what's in that flavor that's not in this one?<br /><br />The can size is just adequate at 8.3 oz, but is, I would say, fairly expensive at nearly $1/can, especially when it's not what you thought you were getting.<br /><br />The drink does, to its credit, have 100% of the recommended daily amount of Vit C, and has only natural juices in it.  That is probably true, but...THIS IS NOT A DIET DRINK.  Just because the can says ""no sugar added"", that doesn't mean that there's no sugar in it.  There happens to be a significant amount of sugar in this drink (given the total volume you get/can)...if I recall correctly the contents label said 35g of sugar.  That's because 100% fruit juice is loaded with sugar, sugar like fructose.<br /><br />OK, frankly, the taste combo doesn't particularly appeal to me, that's why I didn't order the grape version of this product, and now that I know what's in the ""orange tangerine"" I wouldn't order it again.<br /><br />I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars though, simply because it's not really an orange-tangerine drink as advertized.  I guess I'll have to go with 2 stars.  (I don't know why 3 stars showed up for this product!?)  Alas...",Neutral
"How can tang be lugubrious?  If you made it a bit watered down, a bit more aftertasty, a bit less child-friendly.

"Here's yet another carbonated juice drink, comparable with OOBA Hibiscus With Orange, 16 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 12) & <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C"">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  This one, however, is an unusual combination of orange & tangerine.  I didn't really like the flavor much though I like both orange & tangerine separately.  But, the taste is in the bud (s).  I prefer the Izze of the 3.  As for the juice, it's more apple/grape than orange/tangerine & the Vit. C is the silly recommended dose--to prevent scurvy--not much really (per Linus Pauling).  True, it doesn't have corn syrup/sugar/or substitutes--which is nice.  But, at close to $1/8.3 oz it's equivalent to about $1.50 for 12 oz (in a pack of 24 small cans).  Seems pricey to me--why not just buy orange juice?",Neutral
"The advert for Switch describes it as a ""healthy alternative to soda"" and ""a perfect balance beween juice and carbonation."" To get right to it, let us tackle the first claim. The can of Switch I got (Orange Tangerine) was 8.3 fluid ounces. Those 8.3 ounces contain 36g carbs, 34g sugars and 15g sodium and packs 140 calories. To put this in perspective, the 20 fluid ounce bottle of vanilla Coke sitting on my desk right now  contains 28g carbs, 28g sugars and 25mg sodium, and has 100 calories. In other words, a bottle of conventional soda 2.5x as large has less calories, less carbs, and less sugars. Granted, Switch has less sodium, but if we poured equivalent amounts of drink, i.e. 20 oz vs. 20 oz, it would have much more. The drawing power of Switch, then, is that it boasts 100% RDA of Vitamin C and 20% RDA of Vitamin A vs 0% in these categories for Coke, and that it has plenty of carbonation to satisfy the taste of soda-lovers. In my mind this doesn't quite balance the scale<br /><br />As to the second claim: I liked the balance between a fruit juice and a carbonated drink. It reminded me of Orangina in that it is sharp and crisp and has a bite to it, but it might strike some as too sugary-sweet. All in all I think this is likely to be one of those drinks that people like very much or no at all, no in-betweens. However, it can be considered ""healty"" only in small doses (one can day, say) and should be avoided by low-carb dieters.",Neutral
"This product is tasty -- it's carbonated juice (a blend of several juices, mostly apple, grape, tangerine). But the 8.3 ounces costs $1 and contains 140 calories. This is a little rich for me, both economically and calorically. I would recommend this for someone who doesn't mind spending their money and calories on juice.",Neutral
"Switch Orange Tangerine is ok but not what one might expect.  First of all, there is more apple and grape juice in here than orange or tangerine (this will not be a surprise if you are familiar with the other flavors as that is also true with them).<br /><br />Switch basically is carbonated juice.  The taste isn't a bad and it is supposed to be healthier than soda (which can be debated).  It is a reasonable drink for snacks but if you are going to need several if you are actually thirsty.",Neutral
"I think the Switch is a beverage with soda replacement in mind.  The can boasts it contains 100% of what one wants (being all natural, 100% juice, full daily serving of vitamin C, and the clincher, carbonated), while having 0% of what you don't want (no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or colors.)<br /><br />The Good - So with that in mind, I have to agree that it is refreshing to see companies trying to fill the void in ""sodas"" with no corn syrup, with tons of juice and vitamins to boot.  I like that you get a full dose of vitamin C, and a little bit of A.  As for taste, it has a nice slightly crisp bite of carbonation, and it's very orange tangerine-y.  It's a little heavy (read syrupy without being too sweet), but it does have a reconstituted juice base, so it gets a pass.  It's also in a single serving-size can (8.3oz), which is nice considering I typically treat most 20oz bottles as a serving, even though it's 2 and a half and I tend never do the math to figure out the true content of what I'm drinking.<br /><br />The Bad - The price is a bit steep.  At about a dollar a can, it's roughly twice the price as most 100% juices you can find, including most selections of orange juice.  Whereas a 64 ounce carton of Tropicana will run you upwards of four dollars, 8 cans of the Switch would cost eight bucks.  For soda lovers, the Switch is about twice the cost compared to your average 20oz bottle, and roughly 4 times the cost of cans (when comparing equal amount by the ounce.)  Also, read the ingredients, it contains more apple and grape juice than orange or tangerine, which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors (which doesn't mean oranges, just that it was derived from natural substances not chemically made.)<br /><br />The Ugly - The Switch seems straight forward, but it's also a little devious which leads me to my biggest complaint.  Granted it's all natural, but each 8oz can contains 36g of carbs, 34 of sugar alone.  That's more sugar than soda, in some cases by almost 10 grams a serving.  More sugar (even if it's not corn syrup) is more calories per can, so even at it's single serving size you'd almost be better off drinking a Coke and taking a vitamin C pill.",Neutral
"It's a small drink at just 8.3 ounces but that's probably the size drink we should all be consuming so I wont ding it on that point. It's made with good ingredients and as it says `No Sugar Added' but don't let that fool you into thinking it's low in sugar having 34 grams. A Coke contains 45g of sugar but it's almost 50% larger so even without adding sugar this is a drink that's fully loaded. In defense of The Switch at least the sugar is natural with no high fructose corn syrup. Obviously it has no caffeine which I have some issues with so that's a plus over soda although at 36g of carbs it seems a bit high and 140 calories is nothing to sneeze at.<br /><br />So it can't be considered a health drink since you can get lower sugar, carbs and calories from a similar size glass of Tropicana orange juice. So how is the taste? My wife described it as tasting like soap. I wouldn't go that far but I will say the despite its good ingredients it actually tasted artificial to me. I wasn't a big fan and personally I'm going to stick with water and orange juice.... and beer.",Neutral
"It has a nice taste.  Good for sipping.  If you drink soda or juice with your meals, this would be a decent alternative.  The tangerine taste is pronounced but not overpowering.  The carbonation is pleasant.<br /><br />However, it's not a drink I would normally imbibe.  I normally drink either water or beverages sweetened with something other than sugar.  And this has a LOAD of sugar.  Yes, they say it has no added sugar.  That's probably accurate.  But the natural sugar in the apple/tangerine/orange juices in this drink adds up to 34 grams.  Compare that to the same amount of Coke at 27 grams!  I checked a few other tangerine flavored sodas - they all had similar amounts of sugar as Switch.  I suppose tangerines are loaded with sugar.  Anyway, that's a lot more sugar than I normally drink.<br /><br />If the sugar isn't an issue, this is worth checking out.",Neutral
"Switch is a decent soda, and definitely worth considering for those who want mainly natural ingredients. But I think it is overstating it a bit when the Switch can claims ""100 % of what you want and 0 % of what you don't want"" - or is soy something I would expect or want in a soda?<br /><br />For my personal taste, this Switch flavor (which was the only one I tried) was too sweet. It is hard to believe that there is no sugar added to that stuff.<br /><br />So - ok, but not great. I prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NU4VSO"">Izze Sparkling Pomegranate Soda 4 Pk (4-12 ounce bottles)</a> or any of the Izze flavors over Switch.",Neutral
"A nutritionist once told me she could find something good about every food...except soda. Pop is full of CO2 (carbon dioxide), something our body is trying to get rid of, and refined sugar (which can ruin the teeth and provides empty calories). But even so, I still love it. I love the fizz tingling down my throat while while cleaning my palate and replacing it with sweetness. Nutri-sweet brings down the calories at the expense of flavor and has side effects like headaches and giving me a gnawing hunger.<br /><br />For fun occasions, I'll mix lemon-lime or plain soda water with juices for a delightful, and slightly healthier alternative to soda. Will the Switch Orange Tangerine soda live up to my expectations? A carbonated juice in a can?<br /><br />At first glance, the Switch can is...cute. It's a slender can with nice artwork. Fun to hold in your hand when you're used to the typical can.<br /><br />But when I taste it, I'm sorry to say, I'm a little disappointed. The Orange Tangerine Switch soda is not as tasty as regular orange soda, nor as orange juice. For a disclaimer, I'll mention that orange juice is not something that would normally taste great carbonated, so the other flavors of Switch might taste better. I got a kind of odd, bitter taste as I drunk the soda, but afterwards there was a pleasant aftertaste. The bitterness might be present in regular soda, but this is orange juice (with some others mixed in) and I know how it tastes without carbonation.<br /><br />I gave the Switch soda to both of my daughters who happily swigged it down with no concern from the odd taste I noticed.<br /><br />So while I won't be happily exchanging my occasional soda for Switch, I'm glad they are trying to do something a little healthier than we can feel more comfortable giving our children.

"I gave this a try because I love carbonated juice-stuff like bottled cranberry, apple, grape from Welch's and the like.<br /><br />Personally I liked this pretty well, though not as much as some other brands.  To me, it tastes and smells like tangerine, and I felt like I could kind of taste some of the component flavors making it up-the flavor is more complex than you'd get from a fruit flavored soda.  The carbonation is pretty light<br /><br />I definitely wouldn't mind trying some of `The Switch's other flavors...BUT, I split some of the tangerine flavor with a relative, and she thought it smelled like Jell-O, and didn't care for it-she said she'd rather have regular juice.<br /><br />I definitely liked this better than orange soda though!",Neutral

It's not really good for you, it's just not directly bad for you.

"First, I wish I had gotten two can samples of this product so I could try one with some bourbon. I find almost everything mixes with bourbon except tomato juice.<br /><br />OK. What I liked: nice fruit flavor. Strong but not overpowering. The carbonation was OK. Not flat, which was nice. Did not tickle my nose as champagne does.<br /><br />I did not care for the ""can"" taste. I felt there was a slight metallic aftertaste. Really, that was the only thing I didn't like. This product would probably taste better in glass rather than aluminum. Maybe I am overly picky...<br /><br />Overall, not sure I liked it enough to order it again.",Neutral
"I think I liked a similar drink but this one is just there. It's bubbly. It's sort of orange flavored. It has a sharpness but there's nothing about it that excites me. It's a good old fashioned carbonated beverage and if it's inexpensive buy it. If it's significantly more expensive than most drinks, leave it. Buy coke instead.",Neutral
"This is a beverage that is different from the other beverages out there.  It starts with a nice citrus zing but then finishes with a little sweet.  I was hoping for the zing to continue or get more full but it died.<br /><br />The overall taste is not as sweet as an orange soda and not as citrus as an Izze or similar citrus beverage.<br /><br />Overall, this is in between and as such is not going to be my pick as I will usually want one or the other.<br /><br />Not bad, but not what I want.",Neutral
"SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either. I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice, and the can design is pleasant to look at.<br /><br />The orange tangerine isn't bad; this flavor isn't as syrupy as some of Switch's others.  However, at 140 calories per can, this beverage has 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda. Too many for me.",Neutral

"I sampled this product with some reservations. Carbonated fruit juice? My wife said that it would probably be something like Orangina, but since I'm not particularly fond of Orangina that didn't help me much. I then remembered that I had no problem drinking sparkling grape juice so this might not be so bad after all. I sampled this product cold, as warm fruit juice and warm soda are both bad ideas no matter what the flavor.<br /><br />I was very surprised to discover that I enjoyed this quite a bit. I expected there to be some acidity to it, given the orange and tangerine combination, and found none. I did find it surprisingly sweet considering that there's no added sugar. It was not, in fact, entirely unlike your garden variety orange soda with a smoother finish. There was a slight and very brief metallic aftertaste which I first assumed was from drinking it right from the can, but after a second taste from a drinking glass the aftertaste remained. Still, it's not enough to put me off from drinking it.<br /><br />The one thing that did put me off was the price. I'll admit that I'm something of a ""cheap drinker"" - I have a hard time, for example, going to the grocery store and buying a half gallon of lemonade for $2.50 when I can buy a $2 bottle of lemon juice and a $2.50 bag of sugar and make two gallons of lemonade and still have three pounds of sugar left over. I *always* do the math and price out what I'm drinking. (Do you have ANY idea how much money Coke makes off those 20 oz bottles?!?) So for this product, $23 for a 24-pack comes out to 96¢ per 8.3 ounce can, or about 12¢ per ounce. A half gallon of Tropicana orange-tangerine juice at the local supermarket is $3.80, or about 6¢ per ounce. I happen to have a carbonator and chargers are about 40 cents apiece, and it would take 2-3 chargers to do the entire half-gallon, so all said and done it would cost me about 8¢ per ounce to make my own carbonated orange-tangerine drink, so it's about 2/3 the cost to make it myself. (No, I didn't factor in the cost of the carbonator itself so that could be considered loading the dice.)<br /><br />So I guess the bottom line here is, if you're really big on the whole carbonated orange-tangerine thing then you can either buy this product and not be disappointed, or you can make a very close approximation of it yourself for about 65% of the cost (assuming you have a carbonator). Or, you can buy a two liter bottle of house-brand orange soda for a buck at your local supermarket and get much the same experience while saving about $22 in the process.",Neutral
"Energy Drinks are very popular these days.  Most, if not all, are loaded with sugar, various overloads of vitamins, and varying ""energy blends.""  A few energy drinks have tried adding pure juice, but have only come up with 50% at most.<br /><br />If your not a young'un and can't handle that blast of sugar and crash that follows, then Switch is a better alternative.  Switch is 100% juice, ZERO sugar, and lots of vitamin C.<br /><br />Switch is carbonated, so with the Orange Tangerine flavor, picture your morning juice with a little soda fizzle.

Work well and made solidly.

"Disposakups....great idea, because K-kups are expensive and aren't necessarily available in your favorite coffee.<br /><br />Disposakups fit well into the Keurig coffee maker, the lid snaps on firmly to the disposakup after you fill it with your favorite coffee or tea.  However, the problem comes with the filter which wicks the hot coffee under pressure out of the disposakup from under the lid.<br /><br />I tried several of these disposakups. After the first few leaked I thought maybe I was not snapping the lid on tight enough, so I made up some more disposakups and made sure the lids were on REALLY tight, no gaps! They still leaked about 5 or 6 drops from each disposakup, which then drips outside the k-kup holder chamber...and outside the catch area.  I needed to clean up around the coffee maker after use.<br /><br />I give this item 3 stars because they do work, and are a great idea, but the design of the filter protruding from around the cap causes the leaking.  If you don't mind a bit of cleanup after each use....you'll appreciate these.<br /><br />I'll use the rest of the box, and continue cleaning up after each use, but I won't buy more.<br /><br />The seller offered a refund, but it would cost me almost as much to send them back as I would receive as a refund.",Neutral

"Nice idea...to create self-filling cups for those who own Keurig Brewers but want to use their own bagged coffee, or those who do not want to incur the high cost of purchasing pre-made brewing cups.  The idea is, one takes a plastic cup, puts in the pre-molded filter, adds one's own coffee grounds, closes the cup with the lid and then pops the cup into the brewer, disposing of it at the end.  However...the plastic on the cups is a bit flimsy, such that if one pushes too hard down on the lid, the entire cup collapses, accordion style...another drawback is that the lids do not fit snugly without careful maneuvering, so that it can take longer than one might expect to close the cups...these two problems defeating the purpose of ""fast"" which is basically the primary advantage of Keurig brewers in the first place.  Another advantage of the brewer is the lack of a mess, which these cups also do not address well....there is always coffee left to either drip down or on top of the lid following brewing which requires cleanup of the cup holder...granted it is not major clean-up, but nevertheless...  And finally, the potential advantage of cost savings...the cups appear to be relatively inexpensive, but add in the cost of shipping and handling, which is some $6 on top of the featured price (about 50% more), and the per cup price increases...try purchasing multiple packages to reduce shipping cost...no go, the company just doubles the cost of shipping one package; ergo, if you were to say order 100 cups, you would pay more than 30 dollars and a third would be shipping and handling.  In addition to the other problems with the design, it more or less defeats the purpose.  Large packages of the pre-made pods can be purchased for nearly the same per-pod cost.  Would not recommend these, until the company lowers shipping costs, improves design, or both.  You're better off just using the mesh filter pod that comes with your brewer, and simply rinsing it out...same time involved, less cost and lower environmental impact.",Neutral
These cups work for the most part except for the fact that all most all of them leak out the top of the cap. All seem to wick some leakage through the paper filter at the cap and cup joint and approximately 10-15% overflow and leak around the cup and down the sides providing some grounds with the coffee.,Neutral

"I was very excited to see a product such as this being offered on line, as I loved the coffee I was drinking before I got a Keurig.  (My previous coffee is not offered in a K-cup version.)  Very promptly I placed an order and couldn't wait for it to arrive. I placed my fresh beans into my grinder and ground them a little courser than I would have if I was using my Bunn coffee pot.  I then proceeded to place the filter into the disposable K-cup, add my freshly ground beans and placed the cap on tightly.  Great!! Ready to brew my first cup of my favorite coffee.  The whole procedure worked well until the cycle was almost finished and then it happened.  Scalding hot water started squirting out of my Keurig machine from all sides.  I was trying to move my cup to catch the water, but it was coming out too fast and very hot.  I was disappointed with the performance of this product.  The coffee was good, although not a full cup and I had a mess to clean.

Definitely not a replacement for MyK or Solofill.",Neutral
"I purchased this product for a couple of reasons.  First, with the cost of k-cups, this offered a lower price option.  Second, this allows me to used the coffee of my choice (decaf, organic, water-processed).<br /><br />The first couple of times I used these, the coffee was very weak.  I opened a regular k-cup that I had to see if there was a difference in grind size from what I was using; there was not.  Then I poured the contents of the k-cup into my disposable k-cup and it would not fit.  Apparently, the disposable cups hold less coffee, which could account for the weakness.  I also noticed that the disposable cups leak around the rim, and I often get grounds in my cup.<br /><br />I started packing as much coffee as I could into the cups, to where I could barely get the top on.  This made a much better cup of coffee.  However, they still leaked, there were still grounds in my coffee, and it make my Keurig run MUCH slower.  Not to mention the cleanup...<br /><br />My business uses a Keurig so that all of us can brew the coffee of our choice, and we also have a couple of tea and hot chocolate drinkers.  Everytime I use the disposable cups, I have to wipe down the machine, drip tray & my cup.  I also have to clean out the interior of the cup recepticle so that the next person doesn't have to put up with my leftovers.  All in all, these were a nice idea, but the amount of work they require makes paying a little exta for the convenience of regular k-cups more attractive.

Even when to top is secure, they leak into the machine. You have to keep cleaning the filter basket or it gets sticky.  I would advise you to use something better like the E-Z Cup.",Neutral
"Looking at all the disposable/reusable K-Cup designs I think I will forgo purchasing any at this time and continue to use my tried and true *free* method.<br />*Free after the cost of an original K-Cup.<br /><br />After using your K-Cup filled with coffee that you've purchased:<br /><br />Take off the aluminum lid that seals the top.<br />Empty grounds into the trash or compost.<br />Rinse out the inside.  You will see there is already a filter inside.<br />Fill with your own coffee.<br />Place a small square of aluminum foil on top and be sure to make it tight and sealed around the top edges of the cup.<br /><br />Now reuse your cup a few times or many, it's up to you as long as the filter holds up.  Just re-do all the steps for each cup you make.",Neutral
"We use the K-caps so that we can re-use our K-cups by refilling them with the coffee we like.  We have lost or given away several of the caps over the 2 years that we've been using them; so I thought I would buy some more K-caps.  It turns out, the prices for them have increased substantially; so I went in search of another alternative that would be less expensive.  I found these and thought I had found the answer; but they don't quite work as well as the original K-cups.  They actually caused the Keurig to spew water in directions other than the intended direction and then allowed enough coffee grounds to escape that the holder for the cups became clogged and had to be disassembled and thoroughly cleaned before it could be used again.  Good idea - but not quite right.",Neutral
This is what is needed to use with finely ground coffees. It works well. With none fine ground coffee I prefer using my Solo Fill Cups they are easier to use. I have had six for some time and have had no problem except when using fine ground coffee.,Neutral
"Neat concept. Other contraptions to use your own coffee have prepunched holes and are designed much differently than the K-Cup. This is like a do it yourself K-Cup. However, because this consists of a disposable cup, filter, and a cap and is punched by the brewer, I would not be surprised if this mechanism infringed on Keurig's patents. Oh, and the video review submitted by the other reviewer looks suspiciously like the video on the manufacturers website :)",Neutral
"I recieved my DiposaKups and was a little disappointed.  First, they took quite awhile to arrive in the mail, however when I was tracking the product, it did say that it would take some time to deliver.  I have the Keurig Cuisinart, and the cups work ok, but they don't allow the machine to finish the brewing process.  It doesn't allow the hinge to completely close, which won't let the machine complete the brewing.  I have to take the cup out in order for it to finish.  HOWEVER, it is very convenient and makes it much more cost effective, but I don't know that I would buy them again because I'm worried I may ruin my machine.",Neutral
"I'm not happy with these reusuable cups ! They don't hold enough coffee so when using the Keuring system, I get a small cup of coffee intead of the middle button. I hope Keurig comes out with a better reusable k cup holder.",Neutral
"I was looking for a simple and inexpensive way to provide my own supply of ""home made"" K-cups. This product is all that it is described to be;fairly easy to use and does not adversely affect the cup of coffee. Clearly, the cups and lids are in fact reusable albeit a little messy.<br />I have used all 50 filters so I am at a point where I need to decide if I want to continue on with this regimen or go to plan B.<br />I am electing to try one of the reusable style cups that don't require the use of a filter. My hope is that it will be a little quicker and less messy to use.<br />However, if plan B does not meet my expectations I can always order another supply of filters and continue on with this DisposaCups system.",Neutral
The cups are a little tight for my machine. You have to press down on the handle really hard. Also the lids don't fit properly unless the filter is pushed down all the way into the cup.,Neutral
"Good, easy to use, somewhat hard to get the caps on, but at the end you can easily dispose of these disposable Kups after using.<br /><br />Good that you can use your own coffee.  Fresh coffees.  I personally like coffees from Spain, Puerto Rico and other countries.<br /><br />The bad, sometimes is messy.  Coffee grinds seem to leak, creating a slight mess and the need to clean the machine.  This leak is more in the area of the Kups lid and cup.  And some times these grinds even get in your cup of coffee.  Just read other reviews about this.  Not sure if it could be related to how fine are the grinds of coffee.<br /><br />On the other hand, with disposable Kups you don't need to keep cleaning wire filter baskets.  That's a very plus.<br /><br />All considered will probably buy again, but wish a better lid/cup seal that will not leak.  Hope down the road they will offer improved DisposableKups.",Neutral
Not thrilled with these.  Doubt I will buy them again.  Lid doesn't fit very well.  Messy and did not make a good cup of coffee.  Cost including shipping to me was .36/filter cup plus coffee. Don't think it is worth it as I can buy a Green Mountain K-Cup for around .54/cup and they are perfect every time.,Neutral

I expect the single malt scotch I purchase this month will be similar to the one I bought six months ago, all things remaining the same. In my experience, I have had Ahmad Earl Grey Tea that's knocked off my socks with a rich flavor, filled with the bergamot that attracts me to Earl Grey. The box I'm currently drinking is so full of tannin and void of essence of bergamot that I don't know if it will actually be drunk. All boxes I've had contained tea bags with an ample amount of tea and each produces a satisfactory little teapot full of caramel colored tea, but I am having difficulty drinking the second cups from this box because the tea powder residue remains. Instead of enjoying an afternoon of relaxation, I develop a stomach ache, so I'm now skipping the entire second cup.  The tea was recently purchased, so staleness is likely not an issue.",Neutral
"My Experience:<br /><br />It's very translucent, with just a light golden color. It smells like you'd expect a peach to smell, but the taste hints of a white grape juice, though it has no grape in it and tastes more peachy over time, especially as it warms up. It's tingly on the tongue, but doesn't foam up. It's slightly drier than your average juice, with a hint of bitterness, probably from the carbonation.<br /><br />Did I Like it: Yes, though not as much as their offering in Pomegranate-Apple, a 6 out of 10. My wife doesn't like it so much.",Neutral

"I love izze sprarkling juice, it is amazing.  My favorite flavors would have to be apple and blueberry.  I was curious to try the grapefuit one though because someone told me it tastes like fresca, and I love fresca.  I tried it and in no way does it taste like fresca, its much milder then fresca and not a very strong grapefruit flavor at all.  I found it to lack in the grapefruit flavor but more of a peach flavor to be honest.  I have not tried the peach one yet but I am guessing it tastes like the grapefruit one:D lol  Oh well, I am just not a big fan of peach drinks.  If you are someone who likes a milder taste of grapefruit then you will love this, its very smooth.  I dont like very smooth so this is not my favorite, I like my drink to have a bite to it.  It is ok, but I will stick to blueberry and apple from now on. The really awesome thing about these drinks though is they are lower calorie then your normal juice, all natural and no added sugar, and each glass bottle has 2 servings of fruit, you cant beat that.",Neutral
"I enjoyed the dry roasted part, but the Onion-Garlic combination was a little overwhelming for me.  I thought that they would be a little more ""toasted"" than they were.  The flavor was more of an after taste and my wife shied away from my kisses after I ate them -- bummer!  I am looking for something else.",Neutral
"The flavors are really good but the crackers get a bit slimy as you chew them. If that doesn't bother you, then they're a great low-carb snack.",Neutral
You know I really do love this product. I wish I could give the tea 5 stars because it really does brew up a very pleasant tasting iced tea that needs little sugar or other embellishments. The problem is it's loose and when you  are trying to make a big jug of it with two packets of tea it is a huge mess to strain. And ordinary double mesh strainer is not fine enough. I don't have coffee strainers in the house so I had to line a mess strainer with paper towels and it took forever to strain. But when I strained it with just my mesh strainer there was a ton of tea in the jug. I wish the variety pack came pre-bagged like the smaller boxes of tea do.,Neutral

They are uniform in appearance...well shaped...appetizing..and healty looking.<br /><br />The price here is totally right for those of us that need more closer to a bulk level of foods.

So, I bought exactly what it said but did not pay attention to the fact that the medium had rapid gro in it so it died within 3 days. My seven year old loved it while he had it though. He even named it, fed it and took care of it as if it were a life pet!",Neutral

"I really do not know what the issue is with this goat milk. My one year old daughter has suffered horrible constipation since switching to cow milk on her birthday. After a month of us both suffering (because I had to help it along if you get my drift), I switched her to goat milk. After 2 days, she was passing perfectly soft stools. The goat milk definitely cured her of the constipation, but each can I open seems to be different. Sometimes when I reconsitute it, I know right away that it is going to taste terrible because the smell is so strong. Other cans, I hardly notice it. She will not drink the bad-smelling milk, and when I have tried it, I have nearly vomitted! Majorly salty and gamey tasting.<br />Compared to fresh (Meyenberg from the fridge section of grocery store), well, it really doesn't compare. I have found the fresh to taste sweet, like cream, and then there is a little gamey after-taste, but nothing like the slap-you-in-the-face taste of the powdered. I was hoping to save money with the powdered, but since it is a 50/50 chance she won't drink certain cans, I am really wasting money. I am thinking I will have to stick with the fresh from now on.<br />If anyone has any ideas about what the difference between cans could be, I would love to hear it! I always have prepared it with Britta-filtered water (warmed on the stove) and mixed it up in pyrex, then stored it in a large Ball jar in fridge. (I know I should prob call the company and talk to them, but that would require me to actually remember to do it at a time that they are open and I am able - never happens!!)Thanks!",Neutral

Problem, although stated that Goat's milk is easier to digest, we found that once we mixed the goat milk with mother's milk, she ate more infrequently and got constipated with indegestion. We had bought this to help with digestion, as Formula is based on cow's milk. This goat's milk seemed to have the opposite effect on our baby, and she didn't gain weight. Also, the taste isn't so great.<br /><br />We can use it as back up, in case we don't have milk in the fridge. So, it's OK, but I probably won't buy again.",Neutral
"I don't find the taste of this goat milk very pleasing if mixed to use in liquid form; I've had fresh goat milk and frankly, this does not come anywhere close even with reasonable expectations because of the powered form. It does however have its use in my kitchen in baked goods where the flavor even if slightly sour can be of use.

"I'm rather conflicted about this product. Granted, it does taste like actual chrysanthemum tea (like the ones you get at dim sum places) when brewed hot, however it tastes bad when iced and mixed with sugar. It doesn't taste like chrysanthemum tea at all once it's iced and combined with sugar. The tea is enjoyable hot without sugar but it is way too light.

"This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A"">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.",Neutral

I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to ""brown water."")",Neutral

Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall I'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild.,Neutral
"The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol",Neutral
This coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor. I am disappointed though because I looked at the bottom and it says decaf. I dunno bout you but I drink coffee for the caffeine.

I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting.

Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.,Neutral
Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. It's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurig's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking.,Neutral

It's not the boldest coffee, but it's a nice afternoon treat.<br /><br />That being said, I have had problems with several pods.  When you hold them up to the light, you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod.

"I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isn't.  It's a much stronger coffee brew, meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor.  On the other hand, it's a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand (Van Houtte) isn't on sale or when it's occasionally out of stock.  I like that it comes in a 2-pack because our family goes through a lot of k-cups and I don't have to order quite so often.",Neutral

It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the ""Rodeo Drive"" or ""Breakfast in Bed"" k-cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual.",Neutral

It's not very bold or rich, although I can say it does have the bitterness, which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness.

Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.",Neutral

The primary notes are supposedly ancho chiles and smoked paprika, but overall the tastes are muddled and don't provide a 'zing' to the dish.<br /><br />It's a very tasty addition on multiple items such as tri-tip and pot roast but not enough to justify the gourmet price.  It is also too heavy a mix to work well on chicken, fish, or to drizzle over a meat-pasta dish.<br /><br />Note: Surprisingly, the best pairings from Chef Tom for red meats are either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5NKUK"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Pork Rub</a> or a generous portion of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4"">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a>.",Neutral

"This is the most USEFUL info you will ever need to know about K-Cups, and one that took me forever to discover:<br /><br />Bold/Extra Bold coffee in terms of k-cups does not mean that the coffee itself is stronger, it only means that they included more grind in the cups to provide you with a stronger coffee.<br /><br />There! Now you know.<br /><br />My mom goes for the Extra Bolds only because she has been addicted to caffeine for over 40 years now, and she's frugal and thinks this gives her more back for her buck (or rather mine, since I buy it for her).<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of all the Extra Bold k-cups she's tried, she claims that the Wolfgang Puck is the weakest tasting. She's tried it in both the medium & small serving sizes format, and both have produced less-than-full-flavor drinks.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rich, flavorful, strong-tasting coffee, try the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HKZZ7A"">Van Houtte Cafe Honduras Medium Roast, Extra Bold Coffee, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.",Neutral

I normally drink Coffee People Donut Shop, which is a nice, strong cup of coffee.  This was a little disappointing.  It's called a Medium Roast, but when I brew a large cup (my Keurig has 3 size options), it looks like strong tea - very light in color.  It makes a very weak cup of coffee.  When I brew the smallest cup possible, it's a tiny bit better, but I prefer a large cup of strong coffee.  Think I may try the Rodeo Drive or Sorrento, but this one is just too weak and light for me.  (Oddly enough, the first time I tried Donut Shop, I thought it was too strong...as I had been used to weaker coffees.  Now that I've started drinking the stronger varieties, it's hard to go back to ""brown water."")",Neutral

"Perhaps my expectations were too high. When I see the name ""Wolfgang Puck"", I expect to be impressed. This (to my taste) is very average tasting coffee.

Well the creme caramel was on sale so I decided to give it a shot. Plus the fact that each K Cup is individually prepared by Mr. Puck himself. Anyway I quite enjoy these. I never buy flavored ones so overall I'm happy with these but they are definitely not my favorite as I usually buy the bolder ones and these are fairly mild.,Neutral
"The vanilla coffee taste is pretty good and mild, as I expected. But I bought it for a discount from the Amazon Warehouse (otherwise K-Cups are a little expensive). When Amazon does this, it usually means they are trying to get rid of this stock quickly.<br /><br />As I expected, the expiration date is for a month or two from now, so they were trying to get rid of them. I also noticed the seals didn't seem as tight as they normally are. This also could be because it was sitting in Amazon's warehouse in the heat all summer.<br /><br />As I expected, about half of these K-cups burst open while brewing. (This is not usual, and I've tried many different brands.) This made them leak (so clean-up was kind of annoying) and not taste as fresh, but it still tasted decent. Bottom line: When K-cups are discounted from Amazon Warehouse, be ready to pay in other ways! lol",Neutral
This coffee is good and has nice subtle flavor. I am disappointed though because I looked at the bottom and it says decaf. I dunno bout you but I drink coffee for the caffeine. In the picture on bottom of box has text but it is so small I did not even consider looking on it. So just disappointed that is decaf and does not say on page when ordering.,Neutral

"I love the names Wolfgang Puck gives to their coffees, but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />In this case, with ""Breakfast in Bed"", I expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered.  ""Breakfast in Bed"" is on the light side of the medium roasts and has a mild, but not very memorable flavor.  On the plus side, it is a smooth coffee and not acidic at all.<br /><br />A better choice, in my opinion, is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC"">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>, which also comes in the 50 pack.<br /><br />ADDED: Another nice, smooth medium blend is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002APWQ0K"">Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend for Keurig Brewers, Medium, 50-Count K-Cups</a><br /><br />ADDED: for those who prefer a lighter smooth blend, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00196QVPM"">Keurig Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 80 K - Cup Colombian Fair Trade Slect Medium Roast Coffee</a> (link for product description only, not for best pricing).",Neutral

I love coffee with cream. I love caramel. I even like Wolfgang Puck. But his Creme Caramel flavoured coffee is a disappointment. It's not awful. It just lacks a certain depth of flavour. Even using the 'small cup' setting, the aroma is very nice, but the taste is a bit watery. 'Black', the coffee has a slightly chemical aftertaste. Adding extra cream and sweetener masked the aftertaste, but it didn't add any of the caramel creaminess I was expecting.

I would consider it a second cup of morning coffee, afternoon pick me up coffee or a dessert coffee.<br /><br />Flavor is OK.  I would like it better if the aftertaste didn't linger.  For a flavored coffee, it isn't bad & if you are a coconut fan, it is a blend to try on for size.",Neutral
"I Recently bought a 3 pack of this coffee at Bed Bath and Beyond. As its brewing, it smells great (if you like coconut).  The taste isn't bad, but for me, it has that artificial after taste that many flavored coffees have. I gave it 3 stars because it's not terrible. But I wouldn't buy this coffee again. If you're sensitive to after taste, I wouldn't recommend. I'd Grab a dark roast and throw some fresh coconut in there instead if you want a coconut coffee.",Neutral

Taste is good but in my opinion coffee that has been decaffinated should be required to have such info clearly visible warning in big red letters before I mistakenly rely upon it to get me going in the morning.  Small print on the bottom of the box (I mean 6 point font) tells this.  Several mornings of splitting headaches could have been avoided . . . this caused me to check several other flavors online and none of them say anything one way or another about caffeine. I don't know how to avoid this for other products but this info should be clearly stated on every coffee for sale.,Neutral
Too bad no one else had reviewed this before my purchase. It's not bold or dark enough to stand up to the Keurig's 3rd button and tasted a little tangy for my liking.,Neutral
"More than a ""hint"" of coconut! Not very much vanilla. Being a vanilla fan and NOT a coconut fan - this is OK.",Neutral

"The flavor of this coffee is good, it has a nice balance of Vanilla without being too strong.  It's not the boldest coffee, but it's a nice afternoon treat.<br /><br />That being said, I have had problems with several pods.  When you hold them up to the light, you can see that there are grounds outside of the filter portion of the pod.  This causes a cup full of grounds when you brew the coffee, and also clogs up the pin at the bottom of the pod chamber.  I'd say about 1 out of every 5 or 6 pods has this problem.",Neutral
"I admit, I like my French Vanilla coffee to be heavy on the vanilla side.  This isn't.  It's a much stronger coffee brew, meaning more sugar and creamer is needed to tone down the coffee flavor.  On the other hand, it's a reasonable alternative if my preferred brand (Van Houtte) isn't on sale or when it's occasionally out of stock.  I like that it comes in a 2-pack because our family goes through a lot of k-cups and I don't have to order quite so often.",Neutral
I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably won't purchase this again.,Neutral
"I was expecting a mellow caramel flavor, but this coffee is a bit sharp and you really can't make out any carmel flavor.",Neutral
I like bold coffees and should have trusted the other reviewer who said it wasn't strong enough. This one has a watery finish to it and not very much flavor.  I'll be going back to Emeril's Jazz'd Up Decaf and trying the Coffee People's French Roast Decaf.  So far I've loved everything by the coffee people except the organic blend.  If you like strong coffee don't buy this but if you like a weaker coffee that you can see through you'd probably enjoy this one.,Neutral

"We have tried just about every k-cup of regular coffee out there.  We don't do the flavor kind.

It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the ""Rodeo Drive"" or ""Breakfast in Bed"" k-cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual.",Neutral
"My husband likes strong coffee.  I like medium.  Neither one of us like this particular one.  There just isn't much flavor of any kind...coffee or caramel.  We like the vanilla one much better.

"I was so excited to try a new BOLD coffee.....needless to say, I am disappointed. I would rate this coffee as a MEDIUM. If it would have been listed as a MEDIUM, I would have given it a higher rating because this is truly a MEDIUM strength coffee in taste and flavor. I will still drink it from time to time- flavor is smooth, not bitter. Overall, I wish that I would have ordered some more Jet Fuel or Black Tiger.",Neutral
"So here is another example of a 48-pack of k-cups I bought ""untested"".  I figured, well, I really enjoy Sumatra's bold, smooth and rich with a bit of bitterness flaver, so why not?  Wolfgang puck has a few restaurants, so maybe he knows coffee.<br /><br />So, this is utterly average in all departments.  It's not very bold or rich, although I can say it does have the bitterness, which is a bit unbalanced as it lacks the richness.  Purchased only because it appeared on the Subscribe & Save at a great price per k-cup.  That makes two WP's that have been run of the mill at best [Sumatra & French roast].  Next time I'll be more discerning.",Neutral
"I really like to mix things up with k-cups and rarely buy 50-ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.<br /><br />It's fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.",Neutral

"I like the Senseo coffee machine and believe that it can make very good coffee. However, I have been disappointed with the Senseo coffee pods that are made in Belgium by Douwe Egberts. The pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh. The pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak, watery brew. The flavored Senseo French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods seem to me to be better than most Senseo blends that I have tried. In general, I prefer to buy pods from Timothy's World Coffee. The Timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the Senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior, in my view. I have found that the Timothy pods will work well in the Senseo machine if the pod is moistened and smoothed before latching the lid. I use the single pod holder and make a 4 ounce cup. If you must use the Senseo pods made by Douwe Egberts, try this blend.",Neutral
there is not much one can say about Hawaiian punch.  my kids love it.  the only r eason i took off 2 stars is that i ordered 8 64 oz bottles and received 4 128 oz bottles.  i need the smaller bottles so my kids can pour on their own.  i will have to revert to going to the supermarket for future Hawaiian  punch needs.,Neutral
"I love the coconut water - light and refreshing, packed with potassium. I was guzzling it down like, well, water, daily. I don't really enjoy plain water a lot of the time, but this provided refreshment, hydration, and flavor without a lot of the junk and/or calories that other drinks come with. 5 stars.<br /><br />I was looking forward to continuing buying it and consuming it regularly with subscribe and save.

"Every time I heated this particular soup in any microwave, the container made a popping sound and popped up off the turning tray, fell over, and spilled out. If you can catch it before it spills over completely, you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty, pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving.",Neutral
"Love this stuff, very easy to work with and reasonably priced if you can manage to buy it through Amazon with thier subscribe and save program, otherwise it is pretty expensive and you are better off making your own MMF. The Wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough. I had no trouble with this. It also was not too sticky which was the problem I ran into when I used the Duff product from Michaels. So far this is the best fondant I have used. It really doesn't dry out so if you want your pieces to stiffen up quickly or become completely hard you will need to mix in gumtex, tylose or gumpaste to accomplish that. I love the taste of this fondant too, I don't usually like fondant icings but this one is really good! The white is truely white too, not cream or antique at all so you can easily mix in other colors to tint the color you want.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/6/12<br />Lowering my stars from 5 to 3...<br />My first few batches of Fondarific were great, easy to work with, good taste, nice consistency etc. I use alot of fondant and have pretty much used every brand out there plus made my own. I was totally sold on Fondarific until my last couple of orders. I didn't feel like dying fondant so I purchased the colored Fondarific for the first time(Pink and Red) so I'm not sure if that was the problem but they were REALLY soft. Like another reviewer I ended spending an extra 3 hours or so to cover my cake and decorate it because I had to keep putting the stuff in the freezer and it tore and bubbled all over the place. It was ridiculous like working with melting taffy. I live in Washington state and it was October so humidity was definitely not the problem. My last batch of white was workable but also stickier than usual so pieces kept sticking to the mat (even with cornstarch or shortening). So far both batches of black that I purchased were great and didn't have these issues. I have to agree with other reviewers here that the consistancy is lacking with this product. If you get a good batch it is the BEST stuff out there but you have to cross your fingers and hope luck is with you. I may give them one more shot since my first few orders of white were perfect but I will probably also make some marshmellow fondant just in case they aren't up to snuff.",Neutral
"This product worked well for small cakes.  It also tasted great.  For any cakes over 12 inches, it just would pull until their was a hole in it.  It is almost too soft a product.",Neutral
"I did a lot of research on this fondant and really wanted to like it however it just didn't work for me. When it arrived it was hard as a rock, but there is a card inside that indicates about 30-50 seconds in the microwave will make it easier to work with. This really did work well. It made it much more pliable and easier to work with. The fondant took color real well and rolled out nicely. It does say ""no shortening or powdered sugar needed"" that's pretty false. If you're coloring it you do need some while needing otherwise it will stick to your hands and your work surface. I DEFINITELY needed powdered sugar while rolling it out. Otherwise it stuck to the silicon mat I use. Also, after coloring and putting it in the microwave it definitely needed some time in the refrigerator before it could be rolled again and placed on the cake. Otherwise it was far too gooey.<br /><br />Finally, the moment of truth arrived, laying the rolled out fondant on the cake. It was much more difficult to work with than I imagined. It's very picky on the thickness. Too thick it's impossible to lay flat, too thin and it would stretch and get holes. I will say it did get some 'elephant skin' during application I was able to smooth it out using a smoothing tool and the final product looked fine. Perhaps I was a little bit rusty, I used to teach a Wilton cake decorating class and have taught fondant decorating for many years but haven't done a cake in the past 5-6 years. I just never remember the wilton brand, which tastes horrible, ever being this hard to work with.<br /><br />The flavor was fine on it's own, but as most fondants, it's incredibly sweet..incredibly. Despite the improved flavor people were still pealing it off the cake and eating the cake and frosting.<br /><br />In the end the cake looked wonderful and people were pleased but not sure I'll be using this brand again.",Neutral
"I have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors, and generally don't have many problems. If you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of, this is not the fondant for you. It is, however, the best tasting fondant you will find, guaranteed. It does not dry out which is lovely for covering cakes, but is the reason sculpting is impossible.<br /><br />This last time I ordered a five pound bucket in wedding white, it was horrible. It was so soft it was almost gooey. I had my AC at 65 degrees, placed it in the freezer for awhile, and it was still stretchy and soft as if I had been kneading it forever. I even added some gumpaste and a ton of tylose to try to stiffen it a little, to no avail.<br /><br />I was in a bind and had no time to get or make more fondant, so my cake took 3 times as long as it would have, and it looked horrible. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />I guess I just got a bad batch this time. I would suggest that you order ahead of time and check it first so you don't get stuck like I did.",Neutral

"After reading reviews and testing these out with friends, I can say this: Everyone's tastes (and tastebuds) are different. What is not sweet to one person is super sweet to another. So be ye warned, results for these may vary.<br /><br />I found that the tablets didn't make things ""sweet"" as much it cut down on the sourness, almost like a numbing effect.  Ever put sugar on a lemon slice and bit into it? The sour kick is still there, just canceled out. I'm certainly not going to be eating them like candy as some reviews suggest.<br /><br />Tried out a few beer types, with mixed results: Beers that are fruity/citrus ended up gross, as it would taste like I mixed in a mouthful of juice with the beer. Dark beers like an Irish Red were my favorite.<br /><br />I really recommend going out to eat so you can try a variety of things. Certain foods will take you for surprise (ranch dressing, for example, was notably different and very good).",Neutral
"These tablets did work, but were not nearly as effective as I had expected.

It DOES NOT mask salt water. Not sure of a use I'd have for it. It does what it claims, just not needed for me.",Neutral
"I tasted about half of the different foods on the big list of recommendations. Most tasted slightly different. Some got a sweet tickling in the mouth.

The two other people I did it with seemed to have about my reaction as well. One experienced a bit stronger and the other one a bit weaker than me. You could try this if you are interested but I wouldn't buy it again.",Neutral
"I bought these tablets to try during lunch at work. Four of us each tried one tablet, tasted various foods, and noticed no difference. At that point, I gave up, but two intrepid friends went on to try four tablets each. They reported strange flavors in some of the foods they tried, but many items remained unaffected. Among those that were was a fruit punch Powerade reported to taste so sweet as to be very repulsive (like drinking pure sugar), and a cashew which apparently tasted like heaven. Most other affected foods were impacted negatively.<br /><br />In all, we were unimpressed with these tablets. While they did accomplish their flavor-changing purpose, it took a lot of tablets before any change was noticeable. And the experience, though fun, was rather pricey considering how many tablets were required. I was really hoping for a bigger impact.",Neutral

"I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate.",Neutral

"Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />""cocoa.""  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~",Neutral
"This review is for their dark chocolate. Most who like dark chocolate are into the pure chocolate taste and its health effects...not the sweetness! Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it.

"Can't say much about the product itself.  was a gift for friends in California who had just given birth and it arrived 5-6 days after shipping totally melted.  The seller gave early warning before shipping stating the weather had been abnormally hot and that they could not be held responsible for packages missed and left to sit in the heat.  I assumed that was not an issue considering my wife was at their home and aware the package would be arriving and I had also purchased priority shipping (additional $8+dollars).  No such luck.  Be sure whoever you are buying these from gives you absolute specifics before you buy.<br />Just to be fair, I have to say the seller was very quick and courteous with responses to my concerns.  Unfortunately she didn't even consider any form of compensation though.  I really hate throwing money away and giving a less than memorable gift at the same time.",Neutral

Jamaican Mountain Blue Coffee has been touted to be the best of the best world coffees out there by such highly esteemed sources as the Food Network and the kitchens of the White House.<br /><br />I found the low acidity of the coffee very refreshing, but the darkness of this roast has not allowed a lot of subtleness of the flavor to come out.  To me, this tastes like Folgers at its best, but nothing more than that.  Great for everyday drinking, because it is smooth and rich and leaves little acid ""bite.""  But still, after having tried Kona coffee with its myriad of subtle flavors, I found Blue Mountain kinda boring.<br /><br />I guess I disagree with experts, but hey, my coffee is important and taste is everything!

"It was quite a commitment for me to buy this quantity of pork rinds from Amazon but I decided that I would ""give it a go"" since I like the pork rinds that are sold in grocery stores and I figured that these could only be better since they'd be fresher when microwaved.  They taste great and I think that they have the perfect amout of spice.  HOWEVER, two things....the smell is ""funky"" when they come out of the microwave.  Regardless of the taste, I can't seem to get used to the smell.  Secondly, when it comes to popcorn, I have to pop popcorn less than the directions on the package in my microwave or it will burn.  I found it to be the opposite with these pork rinds.  I had to cook the port rinds LONGER than the directions say on the package, otherwise they wouldn't be popped nicely and were a bit chewy.  So if you find that you cook these and they don't seem crispy enough, cook them in your microwave longer than the directions say to do so.",Neutral
"I was so excited to see these! And the price is good.<br /><br />First, it takes a little learning to figure out how to cook these. The instructions are not much help. ""Stop cooking when the bag stops expanding""....they might as well say, perform a Vulcan mind meld with the pork rinds to know when they are done. I found that the bag's expansion--or not---has little to do with whether they are done. I have a 1200 watt microwave and 1:30 was perfect. 1:00 and they were not cooked, 2:00 and I had charcoal bits.<br />I had to sacrifice a couple of precious bags to figure this out.<br /><br />Taste and texture? Well they are infinitely better than bags of pork rinds from the store. The texture is very good. The taste? I am in no way shy of salty food, love me some salt! But these were borderline too much for me. I did sprinkle some cinnamon and Ideal on them to make them sweet and I still had a hard time eating them. My husband liked them this way though.<br /><br />If they could back off the strong salty flavor, I would buy these again. As it is, I'm going to use them to make low-carb nachos. I won't be reordering them though. Love the crispy texture! But can't choke down the overpowering saltiness.",Neutral

I think the idea is pretty good, but the product did not turn out how they expected in my opinion.",Neutral
"These are an okay snack. They don't puff up like the Pork Rinds I have had in the past. The quantity of rinds in the bag seems lacking. There is a unusual taste as if some type of seasoning added that I can't figure out. If you want a salty snack with no carbs they are okay, I, however, will not buy them again. I'll stick with the regular puffed up ones or cracklings. These don't fit in either category quite the way I expected.",Neutral
I did not find the smell to be anything but inviting.  Warm pork rinds is a concept that was new to me.  I found the taste to be very good.  I had no problems with the cook time and the bag did not collapse on the product.  My only complaint is that there was just too much salt.,Neutral

"I bought this out of curiosity after seeing it on the Food Network.  It does taste good.  You do have to carefully follow the directions on the bag.

"The good news:  Very easy to make, tasty good noodles, a few veggies<br /><br />The bad news: 1130 mg of sodium (about half your daily allowance) -- Yikes!<br /><br />Notes: 290 calories, 0 mg Cholesterol, 2g fiber, 2g sugar, 7g protein, 11g fat (6g saturated fat)<br /><br />These noodles are tasty, the broth is OK, there are a few veggies sprinkled on top.  Pour in boiling water wait 3 minutes (or longer) and you're done.  A good, quick, hot lunch when you're in a hurry.  But don't eat too often as the sodium content is incredibly high and would not be good for you.  OK once in awhile, though, unless you're on a sodium restricted diet, in which case, why are you even reading this far? ;)<br /><br />Tip:  You can probably reduce the sodium content by pouring off the liquid after preparing and eating just the noodles and veggies.  Or add your own healthier liquid broth, even, if you wish.<br /><br />Also, you can let this sit for 6-8 minutes of even longer and it will be good and still very hot.",Neutral
"I would have liked to give these 2 and a half stars, because they're basically middle-of-the-road. They taste more or less like a Fig Newton, and you won't miss the fat at all. They are not as soft as Fig Newtons.<br /><br />These cookies are great if you're on a diet because two of them are only 100 calories, however they are on the small side so you may end up eating more.<br /><br />I would say that overall, the taste is comparable to a Fig Newton, but slightly more firm in texture and a smaller size. With all things considered, if a box of Fig Newtons and Fig Newmans were sitting on the shelf together, I would probably just go by price and get the cheaper item and not think about the brand.",Neutral

"Oddly, I have given the cats Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size and they seemed to like it.

It's odd because they scarf up that flavor, and they would scarf up the Turkey & Spinach in the 5.5oz size. WEIRD.<br /><br />I rate it 5 stars for the ingredients and quality. I always feed them Castor & Pollux. However, as always, test not only the flavor but also the size of the can. When I scoop the food out of the can the consistency in the 3oz cans seems somewhat thicker than the 5.5oz (in all flavors I have tried).

"I generally consider Keebler products to be definitely designed for children, and not appealing to adult sensibilities.  I bought these on chance because I love mint flavored products and they were on sale.  I fully expected to find them gagging and that I would have to give them away.<br /><br />Surprisingly they aren't bad.  I wouldn't buy them again, since there are so many similar products which are better.  But they have good points.  Each bar is large, not as big as a candy bar, but close.  Each bar is individually wrapped, which I thought was overkill for a box of cookies, but that makes it easy to throw one into a lunch box or purse.  Note that you only get six cookies in the whole box.  The cookies are surprisingly light and crispy.  Definitely sweet, but not overly so, unlike many other Keebler products.  The mint flavor is fresh and not wimpy, and the chocolate flavor is mild but still pleasant.  The flavors overall are well balanced with emphasis on the mint, as it should be.<br /><br />I'm not sure if these are designed for children or adults.  They seem much too large to be meant for children, and I'm not sure if kids would enjoy this combination of flavors in this configuration.",Neutral

"Is this hot chocolate....yes<br />Is this good hot chocolate....um, sorta<br />Is this gourmet hot chocolate....not a chance.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only advantage you get but using the Green Mountain K-cups of hot chocolate is the simplicity of using your Keurig machine to heat the water instead of using the microwave or stove-top. Other than that the finished product is comparable to any Swiss Miss or other brand of powdered instant cocoa. It actually may be worse if you use the largest setting on your machine. The largest setting makes it much too watery.<br /><br />Green Mountain needs to go back to the drawing board on this.<br /><br />3 stars because it does make hot chocolate in your Keurig without having to dirty dishes and tear open pouches, but if you're looking for good hot chocolate, keep shopping.",Neutral
"I originally tried this as a part of a variety pack. I'm glad I didn't buy the whole package. If you like richer hot chocolates, then you will not like this. I tried making this hot chocolate on all three settings (smaller, medium, larger cups on the three option Keurig machines). All of the options tasted too watery for me. I would often add creamer to try to substitute for the lack of flavor to them.  If this is a machine you have in your office and are looking for something different than coffee, it is, like the stars-rating claims, okay. It tastes like what it is - a mediocre hot chocolate they added to a coffee line to simply offer variety.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer to just use Swiss Miss packets and use the Keurig to heat the water. You get better taste (by a company known for hot chocolate) and the convenience of the Keurig machine. Plus, you save a lot of money.",Neutral

The kids got a kick out of making their own ""kid coffee"" but this was only after we tweaked it with less water and brewed it with 3 marshmallows on top.

"I enjoy a good cup of hot chocolate on a cold day. This is okay. You can't expect much when when all you use is water.

I can let my 9YO make her own cup without worrying about pulling hot water out of the micro and spilling it all over while trying to mix it like you do in the packets.

They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.",Neutral
"Initially I purchased this in good faith for brewing it as iced tea as it is quite difficult to find loose tea leaves in stores. Here's my initial report and impressions:<br /><br />The tea leaves came loose of course but the packaging is terrible. The bag is not sealed and the flap is just folded so tea leaves came out of the bag while in transport. So a lot of your tea leaves will be inside the box which is not good. I would hope that in the future Lipton chooses a better packaging alternative to seal the bag so you don't have tea leaves all over the place.<br /><br />And as another reviewer mentioned, it is true that this particular brand has little bits and pieces of tea leaves and is not as good quality compared to other brands. And as always, you pay for what you get. I didn't expect this to be better than my Jasmine tea in a tin can which costs about $45 and taste fantastic. My goal was to buy cheap black tea leaves which are loose to make lemon iced tea which I was able to do well with that.<br /><br />Here is my lemon iced tea recipe after a lot of trial and error and taste testing:<br /><br />-1 Gallon of Lemon Iced Tea-<br /><br />1. 1 Gallon of water<br />2. 5-9 Tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea<br />3. Empty teabags<br />4. 1 cup of sugar<br />5. 1/2 cup of lemon juice<br /><br />Lipton's direction call for 2 tablespoons of Lipton Black Tea to make 1 1/2 quarts of black tea to drink. We know that 4 quarts is equal to 1 gallon, if we used 4 tablespoons of black tea we would only end up with 3 quarts of tea which is short of one gallon. If 2 tablespoons makes 1 1/2 quarts then 1 tablespoon would make about .75 of a quart. So you would need at least a minimum of 5 tablespoons or even about 5 1/4 tablespoons of tea leaves to get your 4 gallons. I would not recommend using more than 9 tablespoons as it would make the tea too strong. Some people have said that the tea is too strong for the little amount that you use to brew your tea but I would have to disagree with that. I thought the tea wasn't strong enough.<br /><br />So go ahead and boil your water till you hit the boiling point. Use between 5-9 tablespoons depending on how strong you want your tea to be and fill up those empty teabags. The directions call for brewing your tea for about 3-5 minutes. Being a tea drinker I knew that if I brew it too long that tannins would be released and make the tea bitter (yes! tannins are what make your tea bitter). If your water is too hot or you brew your tea too long the tannins will be released in the leaves making your tea bitter. Initially I only brewed my tea for about 2 minutes because I was scared that the tea would be bitter if I brewed it too long. But I found that 2 minutes time was not enough time and increased my time to about 3 1/2 to 4 minutes. That is enough time to brew the tea without releasing the tannins so Lipton's brewing time was about spot on. After you finish brewing your tea add your 1 cup of sugar and then your lemon juice. I used cane sugar and Hy-Top reconstituted lemon juice but you can use whatever brand you like or you can even use fresh squeezed lemon juice if you want. I did try Real Lemon Juice while at another supermarket but I didn't like it compared to my generic brand of lemon juice by Hy-Top.<br /><br />You probably wanted to know if I actually drank the tea without it being Lemon Iced Tea, and I did. I didn't like it nor would I recommend you drink this tea this way. I just did not feel that this tea was up to quality compared to many other brands. Maybe I've just been spoiled by other brands but I just feel that this tea wasn't up to par against other black teas nor do I recommend drinking it as just plain black tea. I particularly like the English Breakfast Black Tea by Stash better than this tea. I just felt that the quality difference was a lot but I didn't feel like buying every bag for $0.09 each every time I went to the supermarket just to brew Lemon Iced Tea. If you want to make lemon iced tea with the Stash brand you need 9 English Breakfast Black Tea bags and the same amount of sugar, lemon juice, and water. Economical wise I would get more tea buying Lipton but if taste matters I would choose another tea brand to make Lemon Iced Tea.<br /><br />I haven't tried making Raspberry Iced Tea with this yet but we'll save that for another adventure.",Neutral
I am a little dis appointed with this tea --  This was my first experience with loose tea --  initially this was good loose tea ---  after having tried for several months  -- I am dis appointed -- first it is a weak tea  --  I have tried brewing it  for long time changing my water settings and brew times and I keep getting same result  a weak tea  -- the amt of tea --  I just never seem to get the right mix  --,Neutral
Save your money and buy a better quality tea than Lipton Loose Tea.  Tea is better than the bagged version but you will want to pour it through a fine filter before drinking because the leaves are broken and some are just very small particles.,Neutral
"Lets get this out of the way - I regularly pop whole habanero peppers in my mouth and douse my food with Dave's Ghost Pepper Insanity Sauce.  That being said, I was looking for the next taste bud hot challenge and figured I'd give this a shot.<br /><br />They don't lie when they say it's HOT.  I put a single drop on a tortilla chip and although I wasn't in pain, I was in moderate discomfort for about 10 minutes.  I think the thing that got to me the most was that the taste was just not very good.  I'm no culinary expert and I'm sure it's extremely difficult to make something that hot taste good but compared to Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce it was bottom shelf in that department.  That being said, I will be giving it another chance soon, trying to incorporate it into a hot chili experiment.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're after a sauce to spice up a dish and leave it (mostly) edible for everyone but the diehard hot lovers, I'd recommend sticking with that sauce.  If you're reading these reviews though it's clear that you want hot, and this sauce doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Heat: 5 stars<br />Overall product: 3 stars (for taste)<br /><br />Scoville Scale reference:<br />Habanero ~ 250k<br />Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce ~ 650k<br />Da' Bomb Hot Sauce ~ 1500k",Neutral

"I purchased this for Christmas 2011.  I love peppermint bark and like to try a new kind every year.  Its a very special yearly treat for me, so I expect a lot from the product.<br /><br />Pros for Scott's Cakes version:  Good organization and logistics:  the package arrived quickly, the candy was well wrapped in the shipping box and shrink-wrapped in a box of its own.  Candy was in good condition (i.e., no broken pieces) and fresh.<br /><br />This seller's peppermint bark achieves a nice mix of peppermint and white chocolate flavor.  White chocolate gives off a nice mellow tone; it is good quality.  There is no dark chocolate layer to upset the balance of peppermint and white chocolate flavors in one's mouth.  This attracted me to Scott's Cakes.<br /><br />Cons:  The quality of the peppermint pieces in the chocolate was very disappointing.  The ad mentions that the buyer should expect to see pieces of candy cane/peppermint starlight mints mixed with white chocolate.  The photo seems to support this claim, showing robustly sized pieces of candy cane in the bark.  I expected a very crunchy chewing experience, which I think is the hallmark of the best types of peppermint bark.  However, the pieces of peppermint candy are in reality very small; there is no sensation of crispness when taking a bite.  The peppermint candy has a chewy consistency, making it seem more like taffy.  Thus, there is no auditory pleasure in consuming this version of peppermint bark.",Neutral
"Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the ""World Market"" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3. Not nearly as good as Tim's Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)<br /><br />It's not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3-stars says ""It's OK.""

"I was expecting some ""serious flavor"" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland.

Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.",Neutral

I am vegan and ""prefer"" to eat gluten free, as I am supposed to due to healh issues, but don't always because there are no other GF desserts that are vegan that I LOVE.

I asked if I could still order some from her int he original formulation, or where I could buy them like that, but she said no.

"I recently discovered buying coffee on Amazon and have fallen in love with the convenience.  I decided to try this based on the rave reviews.  Wish I wouldn't have listened.  Not nearly as good as I expected.  Note that it doesn't taste bad, it's just that it doesn't have much taste at all.<br /><br />Also disappointed in the packaging.  The companies seal on the coffee is a joke and the coffee was all over my Amazon box when it showed up.  This could be another reason the coffee did not taste very fresh since it was not air tight.  Will continue to search other coffees on Amazon.",Neutral
"Read the reviews and thought this coffee was 5 stars.  Received the coffee and proceeded to open the package. What wasn't there was any aroma.

Nothing special just plain ole coffee.",Neutral
"I fell for the hype and gave it a try. I agree it has the caramel hints, which I guess is just not for me because caramel is a tad salty, and I loathe that briney taste at the back of my tongue when drinking coffee. I'm OK being very subtly reminded of dark chocolate, but no other flavors appeal to me when it comes to coffee.  I'm going back to my favorite, Cafe Altura Biodynamic organic French roast, which is the closest I've found to the rich, deep, bold coffee I've had in Paris.  I've also had good luck with the San Francisco dark roast I used to find at Costco.

Purchased this in hopes of flavoring coffee without sweetening it.I didn't find the flavor to be all that amazing but it was ok.If you made coffee with it then asked me to guess the flavor I wouldnt be able to.Maybe because I know its supposed to be macadamia nut that Im looking for the flavor and can find it?In the end I am still trying to find  good macadamia nut flavor.,Neutral

"Overall, the bags of popcorn were just like those that you'd get in a regular package of 8 or 12 bags.  However, several bags did not pop correctly (or at all) and had to be thrown out.

I realize that some of this variability could be due to microwave wattage, but it was only bags from this large box of Orville Redenbacher's that would do this.

"I purchased this product over a year ago, and the best I can say is this is an ok product for me, but could be perfect for you.<br /><br />I used to always reach up to the top shelf, grab my box of k-cups, sift through them to find what I wanted, and then make my coffee. I tried to use the wooden box, but when you can only hold 20, and you use multiple k-cups per day, I just felt like I was always filling it, and didnt have enough room for variety.<br /><br />I bought this thinking it was perfect, holding 36 cups should last me a few weeks minimum. The Keurig would sit right on top and take up less room. What more could I ask for? Then when I brought it home though the truth came out.<br /><br />The draw is very well made and works perfect. However you are adding about 3 inches to the size of the keurig. Due to the height of my cabinets, it raised the machine just enough to not longer be able to open enough because the handle hits the cabinet. For a few days I was pulling it out and using it like that, but that got too annoying. Instead I now use the draw, but not with my coffee maker on it. It now holds my knife block instead, since those can still come out just fine.<br /><br />If your keurig is set up with no cabinet above it, this option is beyond perfect. However for me, I feel like it just added a bit of clutter, but I am willing to deal with it for the convience of the drawer.",Neutral
"First off I very much prefer this look to the rotating holders, plus it holds MORE K cups than they do.  I also like that it takes up less storage space than those carousels plus a machine.  I have limited counter top space and it is already crowded.<br />A minor issue, as I had read before, was that the added height to the machine causes lid to hit the cupboards while opening and closing. I am OK with pulling it away from the wall a bit and will eventually place my machine in a more open counter space to avoid this.  It does bother my husband more though.<br />I was disappointed with the product a bit.  My main problem was the material on the top of the drawer, that you rest the machine on, was not done very aesthetically.  AS soon as I opened what stood out to me was that it had to have been hand cut, and was cut slightly wrong on my product.  First I can still see the pencil mark all across the front.  Then it was cut too short and  coroner was not cut squarely.  It happens to h ave also been across the front edge of my product so it just sticks out to me and lessens it's appeal.<br />I find the drawer to operate smoothly and easily.  you can not reach the back row of K-cups while full but that is not a big deal to me at all.",Neutral
"Ordered this on the advice of the Single Serve Coffee forum.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Drawer is metal mesh on metal mesh, so it doesn't slide smoothly.  It's pretty clunky to pull open and even harder to close.<br />It doesn't pull out far enough to reach the back of the drawer, so you have to tip the final K-Cup out, which is hard if you have an entire coffee maker on top.<br />Again, all mesh, so the cups don't sit smoothly in the tray, and the sections are a hair too narrow so the cups brush one another awkwardly.<br />My upper cabinets are raised higher than average because we are both tall, and this still didn't leave us enough room to open the maker while on the drawer.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />For our modern kitchen, it's nice to look at.<br />It comfortable fits my Capresso FrothPro on one side and two 64oz Ghirardelli bottles (front to back) on the other so it still saves us counter space.<br />When I tried my Keurig on it, I expected some buckling but it seemed to stand firm even with a full water tank.<br /><br />All in all, for $25 it's a lot nicer to look at than the spinning barrel style holders, and I don't need my coffee to be on display.  Plus it looks easy to clean which for me is a plus.",Neutral
First off I'm very happy that my Keurig Coffeemaker sits nicely atop this storage drawer without having to take up any extra counter space. But on the other hand it's difficult to reach the last K-cup in the very back of the drawer. I can live with it but they should have designed it so the drawer extended out a bit more for easy access.,Neutral
"I don't know if I have bad one (doubt it), but it doesn't slide well unless you lift up on it.  It's like the tracks are too tight, and if you try pulling straight out, it hangs, and then the cups inside go flying when it finally does slide because you end up jerking it.",Neutral

I will keep getting the others through Subscribe and Save as long as they are available.  The others are great when I don't want to cook a full breakfast or lunch. I do freeze and microwave them, then drink a cup of milk with them.  Very filling and satisfying.  I recommend the other flavors I've tried but not this one.  I've tried and like the Oatmeal and Raisin, the Banana Walnut,  the Chocolate Chunk, and the Apple and Caramel flavors.  YMMV",Neutral

"I knew before buying that the ingredients weren't all that wholesome: evaporated cane juice, enriched wheat flour, what are those doing in a breakfast? If a product is claiming to be a healthy breakfast, it should really have 100% unadulterated ingredients. (I'll give the Erin Baker's brand its due for using aluminum-free baking powder.) All that having been said, if you regard this as a cookie rather than a meal replacement, you'll be happy with it. It's healthy for a cookie, tastes decent, and fantastically convenient (take it out of the freezer in the morning and it's good to go in 2 hours without heating). But despite what other reviewers have said, it's a high-calorie snack at best. I am a 115 lb female and this barely held me over for about 2 and a half hours before I was starving again. If you're someone with a small appetite, try packing it with a piece of fruit-- Bottom line, it's a healthy cookie, not breakfast, much less a healthy breakfast.",Neutral

"I purchased these with high hopes because I do not seem to have enough time to eat a great breakfast, but I thought this would provide sustenance 'til lunchtime; however, I was disappointed after a few bites. While the cookie is wholesome and filling, it does have a slight aftertaste.  To me it seemed like ""something"" was missing...not sure what, since there are many good ingredients, but I think I would have enjoyed apple/cinnamon much better.<br /><br />Also, I also found it disturbing that even though my cookies were not frozen (probably should have done this since they are a moist cookie) and not yet expired (January 2011), they were stored on the pantry shelf, as they are individually wrapped...but they became moldy. Yep. I just threw away three cookies because I could see mold through the package (opened one to confirm it). Yuck.",Neutral
"If I hadn't scored these during a Warehouse sell-off, I'd even more seriously fail to understand how or why anyone could justify paying over a dollar a piece for these things. Sure, the instructions are dead-on with the freeze-before-toasting method, but they have more ingredients than healthy cookies I can make at home for MUCH cheaper, and with superior texture and without the garbage.

"There's nothing really wrong with these sardines, though as noted below I don't particularly care for their smoky taste. My problem is with the marketing, which attempts to justify an inflated price with a dissertation of a long list of purported benefits. Problem is, most if not all of these benefits apply to all brands of sardines, not just these.<br /><br />One thing I'll say at the outset: If BPA free packaging is your most important purchase criterion read no further and buy these now. The packaging is indeed BPA free.<br /><br />But what about the whole concept of ""wild"" sardines? I'm not aware that the sardine has been domesticated, and the lowly pilchards that swarm the seas in massive schools sometimes visible from outer space are not amenable to aquaculture.<br /><br />On the other hand, qualifying these sardines as wild, notwithstanding the fact that all sardines are wild, does confer a seemingly significant though clearly misplaced credibility. No doubt this will boost sales to a gullible buying public.<br /><br />Read the packaging for these sardines and you can't help but feel you're saving Mother Earth as you chomp on your sandwich. But digging down beneath the surface, there's not so much to be excited about.<br /><br />For instance there's the matter of what happens to these fish after they're ""sustainably caught along the California coast"". The small print provides a clue in that these bad boys are ""processed in Viet Nam"". So what's really going on is that our diminutive sardines take on a heavy carbon footprint, travelling as they do from the west coast to the far east and back again, presumably to harvest the otherwise mutually exclusive benefits of buy-local chic and low labor costs. Nonetheless, we read that, ""These sardines are considered a `Best Choice for Sustainability' by a consensus of environmental organizations"".<br /><br />There are other issues as well.<br /><br />The health benefits of chowing down on this product are highly touted. For instance, ""Ounce for ounce, Wild Planet sardines provide 3 times more calcium and phosphorus than milk..."". OK, fair enough. But is this, as implied, unique to the Wild Planet variety only, or is it once again a characteristic of all sardines? Unfortunately, it's the latter.<br /><br />We also learn that these ""delicious meaty portions"" are ""cleaned and scaled"". Buyer beware: this is quite different from ""skinless and boneless"". ""Cleaned"" in this context must mean something other that what is commonly expected by the use of this word in conjunction with fish. Be prepared to either eat the vertebral column and various entrails, or to remove (clean) them yourself.<br /><br />How do they taste?<br /><br />Not bad, if you're into schmaltz herring. These babies are smoked and have a characteristic smoky, salty taste.<br /><br />But don't worry. It's not just any smoke, but ""aqueous natural smoke"" that they're treated with...",Neutral
"I recently found Wild Planet and purchased both the Wild Sardines and their Tuna.  The taste is amazing in both the sardines and tuna.  It simply can't be beaten and, they use BPA free cans which is very rare in this country.  Thanks to another review on Amazon, I discovered that many of the canned goods I was buying for my family that were organic, were also packed in cans coated in a lining that includes BPA.  I did some research and discovered Wild Planet.  Their tuna and sardines are more expensive but it's worth it because all of their products are sustainably caught, and packaged responsibly.  They're good for our planet and great for my family.  The only reason I'm not rating them 5 stars is because the sardines are processed in Vietnam and not the US.  The tuna is processed here. The sardines are not, and while I'm sure the canneries used are monitored by Wild Planet, I would much rather serve my family something that was packaged in this country giving fellow Americans much needed jobs.  I also think that with the price of the sardines, they should be packaged here.<br /><br />Anyway, if taste is your only concern, buy these sardines.  They're the best I've tasted.  If you care where your food is processed, these might not be for you--altho, no sardines are processed in this country anymore so I guess we're just out of luck. For some reason, we Americans don't seem to care that we now make very little in our own country.  Go figure.",Neutral

The can condition was such as manufacturers commonly donate to food banks, knowing that retail supermarket shoppers would not touch them.

I'd never cooked quinoa before, though I'd recently sampled the white variety in a couscous dish at someone else's home.<br /><br />So far, the prewashed red quinoa seems to require longer cooking than most of the online recipes suggest, and I haven't been thrilled with the taste of the quinoa alone or with a few spices.  I read online that this red variety has an earthier flavor, and I'm not sure that it appeals to me.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is such a good source of nutrition that I've continued to experiment with using it in combination with other ingredients, where the quinoa flavor can be mixed with other tastes I enjoy more.  I don't regret buying this, but I'm not yet ready to replace rice or pasta or oatmeal in my diet with cooked quinoa only.",Neutral
"I have to say my golden and cocker love these treats and they are great for dogs, like my cocker, that have allergy issues and need higher quality food. I bought these at a specialty dog store for 3.00 more and the treats seem to be more solid than the ones I got from Amazon. The delivered treats were not consistent and many were hollow inside. This isn't even mentioning the fact that half the bag many of the treats were badly broken up but I can look past that versus the quality. Great treats and the dogs don't complain about my complaints :).",Neutral

I was hoping it would be chewy like a gummy worm, but it was actually just sticky and soft. Not very appealing. It stuck to my teeth constantly!

"Peanut Butter & Jelly is comforting isn't it?  Something about that mix can bring you back to your childhood or make you think of comfort food.  Sadly, this bar isn't quite what I expected, but it still has it's good points.<br /><br />I like the Larabars, they can be quite delicious.  That being said, I think I've discovered that the ones not involving fruit (i.e. peanut butter, chocolate, etc.) are not as good tasting.  This one, I did like the taste of cherries that was in it, and the touch of salt.  But the peanut flavor just wasn't as good.  It wasn't very sweet, which is fine, but it didn't really taste peanutty either.  Just an average mix of flavors.<br /><br />The ingredients in this bar are very good though.  There's only four.  Dates, peanuts, cherries and sea salt.  That's it.  Which is incredible.  I like foods like that that only have a few ingredients and nothing overly processed.  The bar has 210 calories.  So it's not a light snack.  This is better for while you are exercising or as a meal replacement.  I had it as breakfast and it worked just fine at filling me up.  There is 10 grams of fat in the bar and 19 grams of sugar.  So like I said before, not a light snack by any means.  It does have 4 grams of fiber though, so that's healthy.  And there's a little bit of natural vitamins in there from the fruit.  Protein is 6 grams, which isn't huge, but isn't bad for after you've been running (or before!).<br /><br />I probably wouldn't get this flavor again.  I'll stick to the all fruit bars I think when it comes to the Larabars.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",Neutral

However, the last shipment looked like it was packaged by a three year old and thus it arrived via UPS with a can lid popped open spilling its contents over the other dented cans.

"I don't want to comment on how this protein shake affected my body.  I will only say that I worked out like usual and drank this powder mixed with milk and neither gained nor lost weight.  I like that there was no funny aftertaste (unlike some protein powders containing artificial sweeteners).<br /><br />I am giving this product three stars because I like that it is of organic and fair trade origin.<br /><br />I would have rated it higher, but I find that if I mix this with milk, the resulting shake feels gritty and has a weird and almost unpalatable taste.  If you mix too much powder with not enough milk the shake needs to be consumed quickly!  If not, you will have a jello-like substance that is best eaten with a spoon or mixed with more milk.<br /><br />The two containers I received were probably not well mixed.  I found that as I got closer to finishing the product the shakes I was making started to taste sweeter, so I wonder if the sugar was just not evenly distributed.  Given that this product is a powder, I don't think settling during shipment was a problem.<br /><br />At this point, I will probably not order this product again simply because I find it too hard to drink given the flavor and texture.",Neutral

"The shake is packed with goodness when it comes to fiber and it is only 80 calories per serving.The shake is filling. Plus the ingredients are certified as organic,which is a good thing.

The best way I can describe the taste is ""earthy"".",Neutral
"I hate chocolate. I used to have this on subscribe and save because the two pack was cheaper than buying the other flavors individually. Unfortunately, the only two pack on subscribe and save was chocolate flavor. I was able to get past the taste despite really wanting to try the other flavors, but there were a few side effects to this particular brand of hemp mix.<br /><br />I would get really irritating tooth aches -- in my gums or teeth -- after I made a shake with this. I've narrowed it down to the inulin or the guar gum. I tried the Manitoba (vanilla) and never experienced an ache. I then tried the super berry version of Nutiva Hemp Shake and my tooth/gum pain returned. Also, I would never ever recommend the super berry flavor; it tastes like flintstones children's vitamins.<br /><br />Three stars go to a not-so-bad flavor. I think someone who actually likes chocolate will enjoy this flavor. However, some of the ingredients clearly gave me a reaction, so I couldn't give this product a full five stars. I think the inulin and guar gum are unnecessary ingredients, but I believe it's what they use to make this mix more 'mixable,' as compared to Manitoba's (which has only three ingredients total) 'sandier' texture. I don't mind the texture of Manitoba's. I don't need a smooth hemp shake, but the texture seems to really bother some other reviewers. If you prefer smoother over grittier, then try this one (but I hope you try them both to make your own comparison.)<br /><br />**Update 25/10/12<br /><br />I wanted to say that it would have to be the inulin. I was looking at the ingredients in a raw meal powder that I used to take and it has guar gum, and I never experienced gum or tooth pain with it.<br /><br />ALSO, in regards to how horrible the super berry flavor tastes: I tried it with apple juice today and it redeemed itself. I was trying to finish off the container that I still have and normally I mix my Manitoba hemp with water or apple juice and tried it with the super berry Nutiva. It actually tastes very good with apple juice -- they compliment eachother perfectly. I used soy and 7 grain milks before, so I would just recommend trying super berry with juice if you also think it tastes bad.",Neutral
Its  hard to find this Gyro Meat loaf. Once I found it I was instanly hungry for a Gyro Sandwich. I went to place my order and was pleased with the item price and then was hit with the shipping!!!

"Nothing too spectacular with these hard candy. Tried a few but first they must be removed from their individual and sometimes annoying, packaging. Sugar free is a good thing but who really knows what the term really means when they are using sorbitol? I have no time to complicate matters in my eager existence but must confess that I have been sold for a long time to the name Crystal Light. I associate that name with safe for people trying to avoid sugar, even though I have been challenged several times, perhaps by people that are trouble makers at best but obviously more informed on the subject than I will ever be.  Yes, they have their little taste for they are very tiny for all the unwrapping it requires to consume them and who knows which fruit is which, in the end they all seem to taste the same. Not like eating a mint mentos where the moment it goes in your mouth you know exactly what you are getting. Still, they serves its purpose, for the person that I bought these morsels consumes them without truce, and that makes me content, for I am trying in my limited ways to keep this person from consuming large quantities of sugar, if I can help it, which is not all the time. The price for the Feeding on Dreams: Confessions of an Unrepentant Exile seemed appropriate for what we received and for sure they will get consumed. 3 Stars at the risk of being unkind for I did read the many loving reviews about this product.",Neutral

"After seeing some of the glowing reviews for this matcha, I had to try it. Trying Mango Diablo from DavidsTea recently has brought back to mind my love of mangos and real mango flavor. I had forgotten it in the face of so much fake-tasting mango flavored tea and candy out there. But I used to beg my mom to let me buy a mango. There are few things better than slicing into a perfectly ripe mango. Makes a royal mess to eat it (at least, the way I did it), but it was so, so worth it. Still, I hate messy food, so if I can find that mango flavor without the mess, I am all for it! It was a bit worried about this tea after the strange bitterness of the Peach and Lemon flavors, but what's life without a few risks? Mango makes me think of summer and tropical smoothies and everything delicious in life.<br /><br />So when I opened it, it had that same smell the Peach and Lemon flavors had, a faint hint of bitterness, and I got worried. Still, never let it be said that I'm afraid to try new things. I made a cup of this to take to work with me, and thank goodness I did, it was a hellish day and I desperately needed the energy from it. But...it wasn't that great. It tasted like decent mango flavor with a back hint of chemicals. I don't know what it is, but I think I just need to stay away from the citrus group of flavored matchas. The Peach redeemed itself when iced, so maybe the mango will do the same. I'm hoping it does. My feelings may also be skewed a bit, I've been spoiled by the delicious goodness of the Mango Diablo from Davids, so my opinions on the mango flavor might have been different if I hadn't been drinking tons of the Mango Diablo lately. That's my new standard for mango flavor and this just doesn't match up to it.<br /><br />Still, it will be no great hardship to finish this off, especially in smoothies over the coming summer months. It's not horrible, it's just not for me. But maybe a lower temperature will help or finding another way to drink it. Or maybe one of my friends will try it and like it and then it will have a good home!",Neutral

I added an egg (there's no obvious binder in the ingredient list) and about a tablespoon of sugar to two packages, and cut back on the milk by roughly half. They rose and browned nicely, and had great texture.<br /><br />While these were fine from a flavor and convenience perspective, I would not buy again, unless the price was drastically lower.

"I received the two ""Mission Pack Space Food Sampler with Astronaut Ice Cream and Space Food Sticks"" packs I purchased in the mail today. I initially panicked when I saw them - both were packaged in ""Astronaut Mission Pack"" boxes that said they contained ""3 Assorted Freeze-Dried Space Foods."" This is not the packaging shown in the picture, and there is nothing on the box about Space Food Sticks (I wasn't too concerned about the magnet). The Space Food Sticks were the whole reason I ordered these samplers, as a surprise gift of nostalgia for a friend. When I finally opened the boxes, I saw that 2 Space Food Sticks and a magnet had been added each, so I DID receive the product that was promised. However, I still feel a bit cheated and deceived - I was expecting a fun gift box to present to my friend, as shown in the picture, and the boxes had some tears on them, perhaps from being opened to add the additional Space Food Sticks and magnet.<br /><br />In terms of the food items themselves - pretty much what I expected and I'm happy with them(and definitely what I was prepared for based on what other reviewers said).<br /><br />On a side note - because many of the older reviews for this product refer to additional items that are no longer included, it would be nice if they were updated or removed. I was sort of bummed to learn that this product used to come with freeze-dried food (that many reviewers seemed to love!) that are no longer included.<br /><br />Overall, I'm OK with the product - I got the food items I was expecting and most wanted - but the product picture needs to be updated, and the reviews should match the product currently available.",Neutral
My son loves the Astronaut Ice Cream which is why I searched and found this product.  He definitely enjoyed the packaging (cool little box it came in) and he enjoyed that I found the product he loves to buy at the museums so the gift was not a bust but the quantity was too small to justify the price.  There is more info in the description now about what you get but I was surprised to get so little.  Simply you get 3 of the astro ice cream packs that you would buy in the museum gift shops plus a few small items that were not of much interest to my son.  It would be less than half the cost to buy him 3 packs of the astro food at retail (museum shops).<br /><br />Check the bulk packs of 10 of the astro ice cream from the same supplier/seller.  These are about a 1/3 more expensive right now compared to the sampler but you get more than 3 times the quantity of astro ice cream.  I gave 3 stars instead of 1 or 2 because it is a unique and sort of cool gift for someone who likes this astro ice cream. They would get 5 stars if the quantity was fair - say 5 of the astro ice cream which would be 15bucks at the gift shops then the other stuff and packaging is maybe worth the extra 5bucks.,Neutral

"After reading other reviews on this coffee, I was conviced I had to try it.  It's o.k., but really tastes much more like the cheaper WalMart brand coffee.  It doesn't even compare to Starbucks, not even close.  I wanted to give it a fair try, and after about a dozen cups I can say, I am disappointed enough to not reorder it.  If Coffee Bean Direct coffee's are all like this, I won't be a return customer at all.  I have a one cup coffee maker, grind the beans fresh for each cup, so it's not a case of making a pot and letting it sit.  I really wanted to LOVE it after reading other reviews, but I just don't, and I doubt I will even after five pounds.  I'm gonna try roasting the beans a little more myself to see if that makes any difference. I've never done that, but at this point, with 4 1/2 pounds of coffee beans left, I have to try something to make them taste better..  If that works out, I'll post again, but I'm not holding out much hope.  If you want really great coffee, you should look elsewhere, Coffee Bean Direct is just not cutting it...Good luck.<br /><br />July 9th,2012:  Update.  Well, I tried ""roasting"" the beans a little more.  Took a small amount and put them in the toaster oven for 15 min. at 400 degree.  They smelled good, but tasted horrible.  So I'm using the beans as I bought them, and making due.  Still not the great coffee I had hoped for, but drinkable.  Someone wrote a review of these beans talking about how they had a ""chocolaty and vanilla"" flavor.  Way off base! Or, it was someone at coffeebeandirect.com with a phony review.  Not even close.

I simply like a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />I liked the Melitta coffee okay but I'm truthfully not convinced it is worth its price.  Don't get me wrong, I consumed the whole bag; I am just unsure it is something I will purchase again.

I'm not sure it is any better than some of the specialties you can purchase in your local grocery (I'm not talking Folgers and Maxwell House here, but the other shade-grown coffees).<br /><br />If this product comes up in a good sale, I might be tempted to purchase it for a special occasion but otherwise, I probably won't be buying again.",Neutral
"I like coffee a lot.  I drink my coffee black, and I love the varieties from Starbucks, Seattle's Best, Gevalia, Arriba!.  So when I had the opportunity to try this new coffee from Melitta, I was eager to see what they had to offer.<br /><br />My setup is a Gevalia 12 cup coffee maker using Melitta No. 4 unbleached cone filters.  For the trial, I brewed 6 cups of the Melitta the same way that I do my Starbucks - two rounded scoops using the Gevalia coffee scoop.  I was a little surprised at how light it came out, and it did not have a lot of flavor.  It definitely came out lighter than the other coffees that I have used - I have been getting satisfying results from my coffee maker and brands listed above using this method for 5 years.  For the next few pots that I made I used ""heaping"" scoops to try to get it stronger.  While it came out darker, I was disappointed in the overall flavor.  Since this is listed as a ""medium"" roast, I was looking for something on par with either either the Starbucks House or Peru Chanchamayo roasts.  This may be unfair since these are both Latin American beans, and I could not find anything about the origins of the Melitta Classique Supreme.  I found the flavor slightly earthy, but there just wasn't a lot that stood out.  I like coffees that are have citrus flavors or rich and nuttier.  Ultimately it is more of a lack of flavor that stuck with me.  It is unoffensive but underwhelming.<br /><br />If you are a current Starbucks or other coffeehouse drinker, you will likely find this somewhat disappointing.  If you are looking for a step up from Folgers you might like what you find.  As I think about a little harder, I would say that this compares favorably with Millstone coffee.  You'll probably like this coffee from Melitta if Millstone is right up your alley.",Neutral
I like strong coffee; so when this came I made a pot and my husband and I tried it.  The coffee is ground fine and is bold in taste but not bitter.  Other than that I cannot say I would buy this coffee.  My husband liked it; I can take it or leave it.  Melitta has a good name and maybe if this coffee were brewed in a Melitta Coffee maker and filter; it might have a different flavor.  It was okay.,Neutral
"In marketing terms, I'm not certain what ""classique supreme"" is supposed to mean -- if anything. Reviewing coffee is a matter of taste, literally as well as figuratively, and I found this to be a fairly standard, but not at all bad, mid-range roast. On some tastings, it reminded me quite a bit of McDonalds coffee, which isn't necessarily a bad thing though it probably isn't either as ""classique"" or as ""supreme"" as the folks at Melitta would like. It was very drinkable across the course of a morning, neither aggressively dark and bitter nor bland and tasteless. Though I might venture out from time to time into other roasts and blends, this would be a perfectly serviceable day-to-day option for coffee fans.",Neutral
"I brewed this coffee with the recommended ratio of water to coffee:  6 oz. water & 2 teaspoons coffee.  It was very weak brewed this way; like coffee-flavored tea.  So I brewed another batch at 3 t coffee to 6 oz. water and it was better.  This is not a bad cup of coffee just not very complex & definitely a medium roast at best.  I brewed some 8 O'Clock Original roast for comparison (I thought that would be a good coffee to compare) & this coffee came in second to that.  This is not a very interesting cup of coffee; serviceable and good for people who don't like a strong brew.  I am not a black, tar coffee lover but I prefer more flavor.<br /><br />If you like a dark roast coffee like Starbucks, you will be underwhelmed.  But if you like Folgers or other grocery store brands, this is definitely a step above.  It is not bitter & it is good with a bit of cream.<br /><br />I brew coffee using the pour-over method, directly in to my stainless carafe.

"I will admit to being a relatively picky drinker when it comes to coffee.  I don't make coffee very much at home and when I do, I tend to buy whole beans to grind at home from independent coffee shops and stores.  Because of this I will admit to having a biased opinion of ground vs. whole bean coffee.  My experience has always been that that the preground coffee is never quite as full flavored and generally doesn't taste as good as the coffee house experience.<br /><br />This experience carried through here.  The coffee was good, certainly better than what I've had at a lot of restaurants, but it wasn't great.  I could see this being a good everyday drinking coffee if you're looking for something middle of the road for a caffeine fix, but since I drink coffee at home more rarely and more as a treat, I think I'll continue to splurge on whole bean coffees.",Neutral
I enjoyed this coffee for it's smooth flavor that wasn't extremely strong. It's definitely better than most brands you find in the grocery store. I would recommend this to someone interested in a solid cup of coffee.,Neutral
"I love good coffee but I hate a strong taste. This is perfect! It has an excellent smooth flavor and a wonderful aroma. Just writing this makes me crave a cup. Unfortunately the packaging is ridiculous and I won't deal with it again. It was impossible to open the bag by pulling the seal apart. I had to resort to cutting it open with scissors, which created sharp edges in the heavy foil. with better packaging, I would definitely rate this 5 stars.",Neutral
This coffee was just so-so; nothing to write home about. I honestly couldn't distinguish it from one of the generic canister brands at the local grocery store.,Neutral
"This is good coffee, but nothing to write home about.  I like the grind, which is finer than most ground coffee, although I prefer grinding the beans myself.  It has a bold, but not bitter, taste.  Even though I'll stick to Eight O'Clock as my coffee of choice, this one certainly isn't objectionable and is better than most cups you'll get at the diner.  And it's certainly better than Folgers, MH, and other grocery store brands.",Neutral
"Since it's difficult to explain the taste to you in any realistic and helpful way (A salesperson would tell you different I'm sure). I will just say if it's better, worse, or similar to than some other coffees that I and maybe you have tried. For the most part I would say it tastes like Starbucks coffee.

"I acquired this coffee through the Vine program.  I found the coffee to be just ok, with nothing to either recommend it or to take away from it. The package lists the grind as extra fine, but it is really just barely a fine grind with several larger pieces in it than you would not normally find in a fine grind.  This is not really an issue unless you really needed a fine grind.  It works just fine in a drip coffee maker with a paper filter.<br /><br />As for flavor, the coffee is not bitter, but does not have much of a personality.  I would compare it to MJB or any other mass marketed coffee on the store shelves.  This would probably be a fine coffee to use if you were going to add your own flavorings as there is nothing to get in the way of the flavorings that you would be adding.",Neutral
"I was expecting a very high quality coffee but this wasn't quite it. It's a lot stronger than I was expecting due to the serving size printed on the label. It was pretty strong even for me and I like strong coffee.<br /><br />However, I adjusted the amount of coffee and after a couple of tries I got a nice pot. It has good, but not great flavor. Definitely better than Folgers and the like but not top tier quality.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone looking for something a step up from Folgers.",Neutral
"I drink coffee almost every day.  I sip and enjoy it rather than slamming back X number of cups required to get me through the day.  This is a nice pre-ground sipping coffee. It's not an aficionado's coffee, not so much because of flavor rather than that it comes pre-ground.  It kind of fits in a quirky in between niche.  Not for the Folgers crowd but not for the gourmand either.  All in all, not bad.  My biggest complaint was the packaging.  This was sealed so tightly that I pretty much had to destroy the bag to get it open.  I guess this may be symptomatic of premium pre-ground coffee because they are trying to keep in as much flavor as possible.  However, as an average consumer I find it annoying.",Neutral
"I have become somewhat of a coffee snob over the years and consider it one of the few grocery items that I will pay top dollar for if it suits my taste. My preferred coffee is Seattle's Best French Roast, so comparing that to this Melitta Classic Supreme may not be entirely fair.<br /><br />While this coffee has a somewhat pleasant aroma, it tasted a little bitter. I did not follow the recommended preparation of two spoons per 6 oz. because it would end up way too strong for my palate. I used the same measurement that I use with the Seattle's Best, a perfect cup, in my opinion. I also provided this coffee to some house guests, who thought it was just okay.<br /><br />So the bottom line for me is that this coffee is okay, but not excellent. It is cut in a very fine grind, which I like, but the bean is not very dark. The brewed aroma is not something that perks you up either. If you are a coffee connoisseur and do not like a dark roast blend, give this a try.",Neutral
"Smooth rich coffee, comparable to a local favorite.  However better when I used the proportions, I prefer with my coffee maker.<br />Often I find, when I follow the coffee manufacturer's recommendation for coffee, I find it too strong.  This was no exception.<br />I prefer 5 coffee scoops (essentially 15 teaspoons) to 64 ounces of water.  The manufacturer recommended 2 teaspoons for each 6 ounces of water, which would have been about 21-22 teaspoons. Slightly different, but harsher tasting.<br /><br />All in all a good cup of coffee.",Neutral
The coffee was ok. Not as strong as we normally like so I had to use a little more grounds but the flavor was ok then. The bag was one of those re-open bag but it would not open and when it finally did it tore a huge gash down the side. -1 star for each. Don't know if I will purchase again.,Neutral
"I may not do much well, but people have complemented me on my coffee for over 40 years. I like a strong, rich coffee but hate the acidy taste that some coffees have. I've been grinding fresh beans for about 25 years, instead of grinding them at the store or buying ground coffee. I think it makes the coffee taste a little fresher and with less acid.<br /><br />I served the Melitta Classique Supreme Ground Coffee to guests last Sunday and everyone really liked the rich taste and I didn't have to make it stronger; I measured it properly and got a really rich coffee. It is good but... I can taste a slight hint of acidy after taste that I don't get with my Starbucks beans.<br /><br />I'd say that, if you don't grind your coffee bean before brewing each pot, then this coffee is as good or better than most ground coffees. The convenience of having it delivered and sent by Amazon are real pluses.",Neutral
"I took a try on this one through the Vine program.  For a starting poing, I consider Pike Place Roast from Starbucks to be a four star under this system with Jamaican Blue Mountain being the epitome of five star coffee.<br /><br />I tried the Classique at regular strength and thought it to be watery with a long lasting aftertaste - not a good combination.  At double strength, the taste approached a good cup of Folgers, but the aftertaste remained - slightly bitter and pervasive. I am sure there is a chemical explanation for that, but I don't have it... :)<br /><br />In conclusion, not a ""horrible"" tasting coffee... just on the southern side of ordinary - with a cloying aftertaste that kills the deal.  Not for me, and i would not recommend.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay",Neutral
"I'm not much of a coffee snob. Heck, I'll drink whatever dreck the greasy spoons are serving without complaining. At home, I'll even reheat a cup that's been sitting around all day, as horrid as that sounds. I totally eschew that dark, burnt-tasting, supposedly gourmet Starbucks (jokingly called Charbucks in our home) simply because it's far too strong for my tastes. But when it comes to my fresh cup of coffee in the morning - you know, the one that gets you going, the most important cup of coffee you'll drink all day - I like it to taste robust, hearty, sensual and strong.<br /><br />Coffee made in drip coffee makers always seems to lack this quality. Coffee from those popular machines always has a somewhat ""cardboardy"" flavor, in my opinion. So it was with some trepidation that I chose to receive Melitta's Cafe Collection Classique. When I actually do make drip coffee or perked coffee (for dinner guests and the like), I grind the beans fresh which helps both styles have that coffee shop flavor you can't seem to get any other way, unless you own an espresso machine or a french press, but I digress.<br /><br />Since this is already ground in the bag, I knew that my best bet would be to make it over-strong to help the situation out. I don't own a french press, an espresso maker or any other fancy coffee gadgetry. Instead, I made a single, large mug with 4 tablespoons of coffee grounds tucked in side a Melita coffee filter (stapled shut) and brewed for about 6 minutes on high in the microwave, much the same way I make coffee from Folger's coffee singles.  And it worked, the coffee smelled great, was a nice dark color and I looked forward to my first warm sip.<br /><br />And that's when I became disappointed. As dark as the color was, as rich as the aroma was, the flavor was...  lackluster. It simply didn't stand up to my cheap, easy Folgers singles. And that's a shame, because now I have almost an entire container of coffee to go through. And about that container...  It was almost impossible to open. The gold wire wrap that is supposed to keep the coffee closed later fell off immediately. It took a pair of scissors to open the bag and even then there was some trouble. Compared to simply tearing open a Folger's single, this put one more hassle in my morning that I didn't need.<br /><br />All in all, it was just OK coffee. For a premium roasted coffee brand, you'd think this would knock me out of my slippers but instead left me pining for something else. Coffee, anyone?",Neutral
"I don't drink a lot of coffee, but when I do I prefer it black. If a coffee requires sugar and milk to taste good, it's not for me. I expected anything from Melitta to be a quality coffee, and I was not disappointed, but neither was I delighted.<br /><br />The good:<br />* Fills the room with a welcoming aroma, one of the better-smelling coffees I have had<br />* Taste is not too bitter, even when made a bit on the strong side (if Starbucks is too strong for you, you will like this)<br />* Package is vacuum-sealed for freshness<br />* Better than your average grocery store coffee<br /><br />The not-so-good:<br />* Not the best coffee I've had by far. I would put it below Seattle's Best and some of the coffees I get some a local organic store.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good coffee and we will definitely use it up without complaint. I replaced our normal office coffee with this and everyone enjoyed it, but they would not necessarily want to pay a premium over the bulk coffee they normally use.",Neutral
"There's not much to review here. It's good coffee. It has a slight after-taste of flowers or sweetness, but it's otherwise an interesting medium blend of coffee. The package is a little hard to open (requires scissors), but the coffee itself tastes pretty decent.<br /><br />I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a medium roast. `Well worth the money.",Neutral
"I love a good cup of coffee & the scent of it is one of the best parts, from how it smells before brewing to the final product. So when I got the chance to try out the Melitta brand of coffee (something I've seen in some of my local grocery stores) for free, I figured what the heck? What resulted is a cup of coffee that is better than many of the average brands out there, but still not as good as the coffee that I brew at my bookstore job (when I work in the cafe).<br /><br />The scent of this coffee is great, so in that aspect it really didn't disappoint. It's also french press friendly, but then most coffees are. (But I thought I'd mention it since that's how I brewed my coffee.) I like my coffee strong, so I put more than the recommended amount & came out with a cup of coffee that was a little weaker than I generally like it.<br /><br />The taste of this is very good & is better than the Folgers coffee my mother gets (which I can either take or leave), FAR better than the shoddy Aramark coffee that is served at my full-time job (but then anything is better than that stuff), but not as good as the stuff that I make at the bookstore (my part-time job) or the Dunkin-Donuts brand coffee that a coworker makes. (He's got a specific way he makes it.) And compared to the pricey gourmet stuff my dad buys? This is swill in comparison. (But in all fairness, even my precious cafe coffee is swill in comparison. Like I said, my dad buys the good stuff.)<br /><br />Would I buy a bag of this product with my own money? Sure, if it was on sale in my local grocery store. It's a decent cup & I'm curious enough that I'd try some of the other flavors out there. Offhand though, I'd rather spend 8 to 12 dollars on a bag of the stuff at my bookstore job & drink that instead. Before buying bulk amounts of this coffee I'd recommend that any potential buyers purchase a bag at their local stores first. The price for three bags of this is decent (six dollars) since the bags of this go for about seven to eight dollars in my neck of the woods.",Neutral
"Good coffee. I guess I expected it to be very strong, ""European"", but it was pleasant. (Of course I didn't make it strong, either). The Vine package was 11-ounces, so the ""pack of 3"" is not understood by me. Again, good coffee, but I didn't find it to be especially ""outstanding"".

So Paying 18 bucks (Current price) for 33 ounces (3 11 ounce bags) is a bit pricey for some fancy packaged plain-tasting coffee.",Neutral
"First: we are talking about a shaker of actual gold flakes. Anything negative probably falls into the category of, ""Seriously? You just bought a shaker of GOLD FLAKES."" That being said, the shaker itself could be better; the flakes come out all right and not too clumpy, which is good--I'm using these for a specialty cocktail--but I have a feeling about 30% of the gold I just paid an outrageous sum for is going to end up stuck to the sides of the shaker with no way to extract.<br /><br />Also.

I can't use the candy gold flakes for my purpose so I'm stuck with these guys, and I do appreciate they make a hard to find product, but their margin must be astronomical.",Neutral

Well truffle aroma is just 2,4-Dithiapentane.  You are buying 'perfumed' olive oil that smells like truffles, or at least what most of us have been lead to believe truffles smell like.

I usually have to run it under hot water for a few minutes, which is not a big deal but just one more step.  Also, the price is very high for what this is.

Later, I realized one of the seeds (broccoli or radish), has fuzzy hair in the sprout which looks like white fungus unless you inspect it closely.<br /><br />I got the mix because the seeds are not available in smaller quantities, and I did not want to buy 4 pounds worth of seeds. But given the fact that there are too many blanks in a mix, I think I will try ordering just two individual seeds next time.",Neutral
"This was spicier than what I usually prefer.  Good change of pace in my salads, but I prefer the Broccoli sprouts.",Neutral
"This mix was OK and the price is reasonable, but there are a lot of unusable seeds in the bag that do not sprout - I'd say about 25%.",Neutral
"Crunchy.  Came packaged well.  If you are thinking they are going to be like FunYuns, you would be wrong.  They are VERY mild flavored.  They are ok, but nothing I would crave for sure.",Neutral
"I had originally bought these in medium for my golden retriever puppy. When she finished that box she had outgrown them so I bought the large.  While she loves these, she devours them in no time and her breath is no better. I do not think she fully digested them either. While she was a puppy they helped with puppy breath a lot because she ate them slowly, however I would not recommend these if you have a large dog that eats things quickly.",Neutral
"The product is great, but the shipping was alot. I want to order it again, but I won't because of the shipping.",Neutral
"Now that the Pounce Hairball Treats are discontinued, I needed to find a new way of hiding treats for my cat's twice-daily medicine. I was hoping that these would be pliable enough to wrap around the very small pill. Unfortunately, they crumble whenever any pressure is applied. The cat adores them, but I have to be very careful when giving her her meds now, and make sure she eats the pill, not just the treat.<br /><br />Once these are gone, I'll be looking for something else.",Neutral
"Well, I had high hopes for these treats, which are small, and smell terrible. They are semi-moist treats. Other than the smell, they seem like a fine product, just not for my boy Wesley. He was totally uninterested. He sniffed it once, and that was it. He wouldn't even chase it when it rolled across the room. (A clear poor sign.) So, although the resealable packaging is great, and the cat depicted on the bag is cute, this won't be a winner in our household. Perhaps a different flavor would be better.<br /><br />One thing to note, Wesley has not had semi-moist treats before, so that could be it as well. Hopefully your cat will have happier results!",Neutral
"I mean you get 2 bottles for a very affordable price!<br /><br />Yes, it isn't the highest quality, but it is wonderful for the price. I add this oil to meats, lasagna's grounds etc. and it has added some great flavor. If you want more, then go for the much more expensive stuff (no guarantee it will be any better) or go for truffle pastes or other forms of truffles (which are much more pricey).<br /><br />I am satisfied, though the packaging was not all that great, but my item arrived in good condition.",Neutral
"Great value for an infused truffle oil, however I enjoy the White Oil better for basically the same price.  I'm sure I'll use it all up and then just order that one instead next time.  They're both good.  Love it in mushroom quiche or garlic mashed  potatoes!",Neutral
"Earl grey is definitely one of my favorite flavors, however I had to knock a couple stars off the Twinnings brand (sorry - their other products tend to be the best!) as I find the Bergamot flavor to be too strong.  It borders on fruit/perfume.  Those who like the Bergamot flavor to overtake the tea flavor may rate this a full five stars, however for me it was too much like candy (I compare it to the way grape candy would come through your nose) and not enough like tea.  I find the celestial seasonings version of this tea (in decaf) to be flawless.",Neutral
"The tea was OK but had an odd ""flowery"" after-taste. I like teas that are more ""pungent"" so this one was not totally my preference - but, as I said, OK.",Neutral
"I love Earl Grey tea, but I'm trying to avoid caffeine. I was happy to find the Twinings Decaf Earl Grey tea, because locally I can only get herbal tea K-cups if I want to go caffeine-free. I have had the Twinings brand Earl Grey tea (with caffeine) in both tea bags and in a Tassimo T-disc. The K-cup version of their Earl Grey tea seems to have a much stronger bergamot taste than the other versions. I like my tea on the weak side, so I brew on the 10 oz. or 12 oz. setting - even so, the bergamot taste is still very strong (almost too much). If you are looking for Earl Grey K-cups and don't mind caffeine, I would try the Celestial Seasonings or Bigelow brands - they are better. If you are trying to avoid caffeine, these will give you more options and although not great - they still make a decent drink.",Neutral
"Strong oil smell is nice, but the flavor is a bit bland. I prefer the Bigelow. And no, I don't work for Bigelow. :)",Neutral
"I thought it was caffeinated. I was wrong. It put me out of energy for 20 days. Never again. BUT, the taste is good. A little strong though",Neutral
"Love Twinings Earl Grey in regular form, thought this would be a good choice for a cup of tea or 2 in the evening.  To be honest decaf tea is rarely satisfying, and this is the best of the options available.  Sorry Twinings, I love you I really do, its not you its me...decaf is not my cup of tea.",Neutral
"This is at best an average tea. It's not bad, just not great. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. I tend to think the Keurig, while a great coffee maker, is not the best tea brewer.",Neutral
"I loved the Celestial Seasonings Earl Grey Decaf, but apparently it's discontinued and this has replaced it.  I don't like this nearly as much as the Celestial Seasonings.  Bah!  I feel betrayed.",Neutral
"First thing first, my dog goes absolutely nuts over this!<br />She can smell the roast beef flavor from another room.<br /><br />I originally bought this as a healthy alternative to rawhides for my dogs teeth.<br />But after reading the ingredients, there is really nothing healthy about it.<br /><br />It's nice the product is fortified with vitamins, but not so nice when it's full of grains and fillers as the base ingredients.<br />I went with Sam's Yam's Sweet Potato Raw Hides, as they are truly ""natural"".<br /><br />But for those who are feeding low-grain or no-grain dog food, this should be ok as a once-in-a-while treat.<br />But if your dog is on a more generic dog food, then there is absolutely no place for even more grains in their treats.",Neutral
"I read the reviews of this dog food and everyone said their picky eating dog loved it. I have a miniature schnauzer who is 10 months old and he is a very picky eater! He was eating Nutro Max Lamb & Rice for puppies but started to show a little dis-interest in his food. I wanted to try something new and I chose this product. He did not like this food at all! I wouldn't buy it again, personally. The ingredients are good but my dog just didn't like it.",Neutral
"I was recently introduced to Genmai cha by a friend who's husband works for a company that does business with Japan.  I was at once intrigued and desirous to purchase more of the same.  However, I am still unable to find a similar tea with the same delicate taste.  Unfortunately, Yamamotoyama Genmai Cha is just adequate.  I am still on my quest to find that same delicate flavor I found in those tea bags my friend gave me.  Wish me luck in my search!",Neutral
"It is not real macha.<br />I'm kinda disappointed with that.<br />I expect that is green, but actually it is dark.",Neutral
it was ok i thought it would be tastier i probably won't buy it again. it was very bland and didnt satisfy my taste buds,Neutral
"I like the convience of the McDougall soups.  This is not my favorite.  It seems to need bread with.  I use these soups for work.  Most of them are very filling and taste great.  This one taste really good.  But, I seem to be a little hungry.",Neutral
"Though not my favorite this is ok, great for those on diets where you need to limit Sodium, fat and etc. My recommendation though is you follow the instructions that were on a different flavor. After following the initial instructions instead of letting it sit after stirring, microwave at 20% power for an addt'l 5 mins. The flavors meld better and the pasta is a much better texture.",Neutral
"There's nothing really wrong with this soup. It's a little bland, and there isn't enough there to make it a meal. It would be okay for an afternoon snack, though. The beans and pasta DO soften up fine, if you follow the directions.",Neutral
"I use this lemon oil to add a few drops to my drinking water for a refreshing change.  The only thing I would like to see done differently is a packaging change, to put in a rubber seal with a drop-control feature, so I could add just a few drops instead of having to be careful not to pour too much in.",Neutral
"The only reason for the 3 stars was the packets the individual teas were in.  I love this tea, I have the ones in the tin on auto delivery.  I was taking a trip, and ordered these so I could take some with me on my trip.  Prior to leaving home I took some out of the box and put them in my suitcase.  I got to the hotel and tried to open the little packages.  Impossible to open the individual packages.  No knife with me, I ended up using a toe nail clipper to open the individual packages of each tea.<br /><br />Hopefully this was just a problem with the first box, but I would not recommend buying this tea in the boxes, go for the cannisters.  If you do buy the boxes have something near by to open each and every packet of tea.",Neutral
"I was excited to try these Pork Rinds and so when they came, I popped some in the Microwave immediately.  If you are a traditional Pork Rind Lover, these are probably not for you.  They have the consistency of a Rice Cake.  Although they taste like a pork rind, it is not the same as the ""feel"" of a pork rind.  There is no ""air"" pockets, or crackling sensation that you get with holding a ""regular"" rind in your mouth.  I am sure these are great for some, but I am just not ready to call this good.  I gave my bag to a friend.  Lesson Learned.",Neutral
"I would've thrown the whole bag out if not for my convection oven. My first microwave batch turned out HORRIBLE. 1/2 cooked and no puffy/fluffy pieces at all! I popped some onto my infrared NuWave oven and they puffed up after 8 mins. FINALLY- something edible and YUMMY!<br />Glad they are healthier than the MSG/other additive types of rinds, but kinda high maintenance as far as how to properly prepare them. I think I will try to find easier-to-prep ones...bummer.",Neutral
"Purchased this as an experiment to see what the effects would be.  Nothing happened.  Don't know if that's due to something specific about this company's product, or whether any sceletium tortuosum would have had no effect.  For the price it was worth experimenting, but a downer when nothing happens.",Neutral
"I was expected a lot better. i LOVE the beef jerkey nuggets they are so juicy n flavorful and delicious, but when i ordered these just to try them cause i couldnt find them in any store i wasnt too happy. when i tried them they were extremely greasy and not that much flavor.",Neutral
"I'm a big fan of Buffalo chicken and beef jerky, so I thought I'd love the Jack Link's Flamin Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.  I was wrong.  I bought the Steak Nuggets as well, which aren't as good as Jack Link's jerky, but definitely tasted better than the Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.<br />To put it bluntly, they tasted like an old chunk of salty chicken with a slight Buffalo flavor.  They're not very spicy, I was expecting more of a kick.  They also smelled a little funny.  I'd give Buffalo chicken jerky a try, but I won't be buying these ever again. They're OK, but there's so many better options out there.",Neutral
"I thought this would be spicy, and coming from someone who eats spicy food all the time and fire sauce on his burritos, this is really only mild. This does not make your nose run, or make your throat burn, ears tingle, which is the funnest part of eating spicy food. Spicy food containing cayenne pepper is very healthy for you and is great for colds and sore throats. With a name like Flaming Buffalo with fire coming out of the name I had high hopes...and sadly this does not live up to the hype in the heat department. It still tastes good. The flavor lingers in your mouth making you reach for another one, after 6-8 pieces or so you get a salty taste that makes you reach for water. I give this 3 stars for taste and convenience. Just in case you don't eat it all in one sitting, the bag contains a zip-lock storage to keep things sealed. It will last 3 days after opening without refrigeration.",Neutral
"I actually really love the Jack Link's Original Beef Steak Nuggets, however the 4 pack I received seemed to be old.  They weren't nearly as good as the ones I have purchased in gas stations.  Makes you wonder why that would be. These were tough and much drier then I expected. I have to say I will not order them again through the mail. If they had been fresher I would have rated them as I love them because I really do.",Neutral
"I don't eat beef and having a jerky snack around is nice.  Bag is enormous for what's inside it.  There's basically food in the bottom 3 inches of the bag, and, because of the sauce, if you reach your hand in instead of shaking it out of the bag into your hand, you'll end up with dirty hands.  A much smaller bag would make sense.  I'd also like to see more for the price.  Flavor is good.",Neutral
They have a funky flavour and really get all over you fingers. I bought these to eat while driving it it isn't going to work.,Neutral
"We have 7 dogs. 6 of them wouldn't eat this, the 7th acted like it was the best thing ever.<br /><br />the treats themselves look nice enough, small squares, sort of like cookies. bite sized for most dogs and didn't have any colors in them to run on the carpet or anything like that. So its really all about whether or not your dog likes lamb and barley. Hope that helps you",Neutral
"It's hard to review something a dog eats. Our dog didn't say anything about this treat, but he did gobble it up heartily. Then again, he gobbles up any treat I give him. I can't say I noticed anything different about his reaction to this treat than compared to, say, Milk Bones, except it takes him longer to eat these (they are hard). The makers leave it up to the dog owners to know or assume the benefits of this treat, because it doesn't say what they are on the bag. The bag lists a lot of features, like Organic, No Wheat, No Corn and Baked in Small Batches, but it doesn't say why these things are beneficial. The back of the bag has a fictional story about Newman's dog rumored to be writing a Tell All book. I assume it must appeal to Newman's target audience, and I'm not in that audience. Maybe it's just the marketing consultant in me, but I think it would be useful to list the benefits as well as the features.",Neutral
"My dog seemed to really like these treats, but he's nearly 12 years old (he's a German Shepherd mix), and they were SO hard on his teeth. We usually buy him softer, easier to chew cookies because he's teeth are old. He liked these, but they were hard as rocks so after a while he started turning them down, and I'm pretty sure it was because of the hardness. I could see that he actually had trouble biting down on them.<br /><br />However, I think if you have a younger dog who can handle the hard-as-rocks issue, then these would be great. They are definitely all natural, and the ingredients list is very short. They use all natural, organic ingredients, no chemicals, nothing nasty or artificial. They even smell pretty decent. They smell like barley to me, which of course is one of the ingredients.<br /><br />We are big into feeding our dog natural treats and food with no added preservatives, so we were pleased with that aspect of these treats.",Neutral
"My Shepherd mix ate the first one of these I gave him right away, but waited with the second. The biscuit is thick and hard, and it is scored down the middle so that owners of mid-sized dogs can break it in half. I don't think it's going to be small enough for small dogs, and it's hard to break other than where it is scored. I'm sure these will get eaten, and I'm glad they are organic and have good ingredients, but they weren't especially a favorite. I would say my dog likes the Newman chicken biscuits, the heart-shaped ones, better. They are thinner, and possibly easier to chew, altho he doesn't really hesitate about chewing bones. Not really sure what goes on in his mind, but maybe a hard cookie is not enticing enough for an energetic chew?",Neutral
"What is ""four ears up""?  Read on, I'll explain later.<br /><br />The first thing I did when I received the Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley Treats was to read the lable.  Darn near everything is listed as organic.  Whether that is good or bad is a matter of personal opinion and personally, I don't even look for organic food for myself.  Is organic food actually healthier?  I don't know, but for the purposes of this review, that's neither here nor there.  The treats themselves are hard and crunchy and about 1"" x 2"" in size.  Each is scored so they can be broken in half.  I preferred to break them in half for all my dogs even though none would have had issues with the size.<br /><br />My house seems to revolve around my 4 rescued dogs, 2 Australian Kelpie mixes, a Yellow Lab mix, and a beautiful Heinz 57, maybe a doberman/border collie mix.  Weights run from 30 lbs to 85 lbs.  At one point in their lives, all of them had been abused and I do know for a fact that 2 had been starved.  As a result none are too picky about dog food or treats.  When presented with the Newman's treats for the first time 3 dogs took them quickly, but not as quickly as usual.  One dropped the treat and sniffed it before eating it.  My lab spent about 15 seconds sniffing before she would take it.  When given their regular brand of treats, the lab usually sniffs for just a second before taking it and the others just grab and inhale them.  At another treat time each dog was presented with 2 treats side by side on the floor, one of the Newman's and one of their regular brand.  Two dogs, including the hesitant Lab, chose their regular brand first before eating the Newman's.  The 2nd time I tried that, 3 out of four at their regular brand first.  That pretty much ended the experimentation and I just gave the Newman's treats until they were gone. One of the Kelpies actually refused the Newman's a couple of times which for him was highly unusual since he's usually the first in line at treat time. The others never did seem overly excited about eating organic but did eat them.  When we changed back to the usual brand they scarfed them down as usual.<br /><br />Now we get to the ""four ears up"".  When my four are really excited about something they will sit at full attention with their ears completely perked up.  At the treat times when they were being fed the Newman's, they initially started out with perked ears then once they found out what they were getting, their excitement faltered and they seemed somewhat indifferent.  Since there are four dogs with 2 ears each, an ""8 ears up"" would be a perfect rating where they were excited about eating or doing something.  Since, with the 2 exceptions, they never did refuse the Newman's but ate them without much excitement, these treats get a ""four ears up"" rating, pretty much middle of the road.<br /><br />If feeding your dogs organic treats is important to you, definately give thee a try.  Just be forewarned that they may be a bit on the large side for small dogs and they do seem harder and crunchier than some other brands.  Given the cost and the lackluster response from my dogs, it's highly unlikely that I'll be giving them the Newman's in the future.",Neutral
"Normally when UPS drives up, my dog (mixed poodle, 20lb), goes nuts because he knows there's a good chance a package of goodies is being delivered.  If I tell him he's got a package, he'll happily and eagerly  open it himself.  This time, after a few sniffs, he couldn't care less.  He lost interest in the package right away.  I took two treats out for him and he just looked at them and walked away.  To be fair, he IS pretty picky.  Like all treats, some dogs will like them, some won't.",Neutral
"Let's face facts, dogs will pretty much eat anything that you put in front of them - they really are not that choosy.  They drink dirty garden water, smell each other privates, and occasionally snack on cat turds, so trying to determine if a treat tastes good really is not that easy.<br /><br />Having said that, my two medium size dogs (roughly 30 pounds each) absolutely love these treats. I like the fact that they don't have that smelly dog treat scent that most have (they smell more like people food - kind of like a ginger snap), and because they are harder and larger than my normal treats, the dogs must crunch them, promoting tooth cleanliness. But if you have a smaller dog (I also have a Yorkie), these treats are just way too large.<br /><br />They are about two inches long and one inch wide (with a perforation in the middle). They contain organic ingrediants including carrots, apples and molasses, rather than fillers like corn meal.  They are relatively easy to break at the perforation - but really hard to break down further (though a hammer works well).  My Yorkie looked down at the treat then looked up at me with an expression of ""you gotta be kidding me"" and stared at me until I gave him one of his regular treats.<br /><br />The only drawback is that unless they are purchased in bulk, they are a bit expensive, so I would not use them as a training treat. But for the occasional atta boy treat - my older boys love them.",Neutral
"Let's face it- if your dog is anything like mine, s/he'll eat anything. It's the same story here. Our dog gobbled these things up post-haste.<br /><br />Thing is they're hard, brownish, unappetizing squares. In most cases they're actually stuck together into rectangles you need to break apart. and they're really hard to break apart. One square's pretty big for our little terrier, but the rectangles were HUGE. I tried to break 'em into squares- but couldn't even with a knife.<br /><br />I gave up and handed the treat to our dog who was just happy to gnaw away.",Neutral
"My pup, Lucy, will take these biscuits and set it down for a while before eating.  She doesn't go gaga over them but she knows these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045XE32E"">Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, 10-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a> are treats and likes to receive them.<br /><br />Since lamb is second on the ingredients list after barley I expected the treats to be more meaty and semi-soft but out of the package they smell like a whole grain cookie with a slight hint of molasses.  I get no meat or lamb aroma from them at all.  The biscuits are about 0.5"" thick and 1"" x 2.5"" in size with a score line so you can break it cleanly in half.<br /><br />I'm pleased that there are only 6 ingredients in the mix but palm oil is being used which, organic or not, takes away some of the health appeal.  Regardless, I would consider these treats to be healthier than most.<br /><br />Would I buy a 6-pack of 10-oz bags? I find the price point somewhat high for biscuit treats so I would consider it if Lucy really showed interest in them but at this time these treats are not high on my shopping list.",Neutral
"This review is based on my impression of the Newman's dog treats, and the reaction of my two dogs. The variables:<br /><br />1) I have two Lhasapoos (mixed breed), almost 13 yrs old, with healthy teeth.<br />2) One is 13 lbs & one is 11 lbs, comparable in size to a large (not fat) house cat.<br />3) They are fed dry dog food, which is left in a feeder, so they eat whenever they like -- even so, they only eat small amounts.<br />4) When they are given a ""treat,"" it's not all the time, and they receive either a dog biscuit or a raw-hide stick -- never people food.<br /><br />When I opened the bag, the Newman treats didn't smell any differently than their usual dog biscuits, and I was concerned with the large size. I noticed they had an indentation in the middle, but only a few biscuits were easy to break in half; most of them were just too hard to snap -- and I have strong hands...I can't imagine someone with arthritis being able to break one of these in half. The Newman treats are a great size for a bigger breed, like a golden retriever, for instance.<br /><br />I put the Newman biscuits in the same canister that I use for other treats, even though the bag is resealable. I wasn't sure if the bag would affect my dogs' reactions to a new treat. By the way, I did read all the ingredients on the bag & it all looked healthy to me. I didn't see a reason why the dogs wouldn't like the treats.<br /><br />I gave them half a piece each, after their morning potty break; they do not eat at night because they sleep in our bedroom with the door closed. They appeared very excited until the pieces were in their mouths, and then both dogs spit the pieces out & stared at me like I just tried to feed them dirt. I told them, ""you're not getting anything else for a treat,"" and walked away; they reluctantly ate the pieces. Over the past week or so, I've given them a whole biscuit every other day. They always eat them, but they don't wolf them down (no pun intended, really) they way they do with their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EBIP5W"">Milk-Bone Biscuits for Small Dogs</a>.<br /><br />Perhaps it is a texture issue? Too bad my dogs can't tell me...not to give TMI, but I am the one who does ""poop patrol"" in the backyard & the biscuits don't seem to have affected the consistency or size of the poop. (Look, I don't normally review dog food -- I'm not sure what other dog owners would be concerned about LOL)<br /><br />Anyway, I don't recommend this product for dogs under 25 lbs, or dogs with weak teeth or dental problems that could affect crunching-ability.",Neutral
"I have a 3 month old puppy that is teething right now, so I thought these would be good for him. I thought that, this treats being hard that he would gnaw on them for a while to keep him busy. Nope, he either had no interest in it, or lost interest in it fast. And now, I have these square treats lying around my house.<br /><br />These don't really look like treats, and my puppy really doesn't know what to do with it. He might be too young for these? But, I didn't see an age requirement on the bag. I don't know, these treats remind me of something you would give a hamster, rabbit or gerbil to chew on.<br /><br />I read a lot of review on here saying their dogs just love this and wanted more. My dog acts like I am giving him a rock. He did play with the treat a bit and carried it around the house. But, I don't think he has finished one completely.",Neutral
"Gave this to my mother for her Doberman,  and Akkita/Shepard mix.  That said,  she has two large dogs.<br />So, they didn't like it at all,  and wouldn't touch it unless there wasn't  anything left in the house for them to eat,  Then they ate it.<br /><br />I'm not sure if they don't like this type,  flavor,  or brand,  or just aren't very fond of biscuits.  They don't seem to have too much of a problem with the milk bone brand biscuits.  Dogs are fussy,  it's really hard to find treats for dogs.<br /><br />Mine like chicken strips... And sweat potato sticks.  Greenies,  haven't really found much else.  Chicken flavor pup er ronie. Don't like beggan strips, love anything duck....  Does this give you a better idea of what my dogs taste buds are like?  Your dog may be different,  I dont know if you can really judge by what our dogs like.<br /><br />I'll rate it 3 stars since they ate it,  just not as a first option.",Neutral
"I can't give these less than 3 stars because... well, dogs eat them.<br /><br />However, be aware that these are another brand of extremely hard dog biscuit, while most dogs I have known seem to get most excited by softer (and stinkier) treats.  In fact, these might even be harder than the common milkbone stuff.  I can't comment on taste, but soft and stinky definitely get the biggest reactions.",Neutral
"Right out of the bag, these are dense, oaty-smelling biscuits that look like hardtack.  My dogs loved the taste, and I felt really good about feeding them something with an ingredient list that talked about organic ingredients.  However, neither of my dogs tolerated these well.  If your dog has a sensitive stomach, this might not be the dog biscuit for you.<br /><br />Just for reference, I have an older full-breed corgi and a younger corgi/chihuaha mix.  My older dog has definitely developed gluten and corn allergies over the years, while the corgi mix just has a sensitive tummy.  That's probably why they couldn't tolerate these--it's not the fault of the ingredients.",Neutral
"First I want to say my dog is a carnivore, he primarily eats raw meat. I do allow him many treats other than carrots but he will jump at the chance to eat anything I toss at my chickens.  For that reason I wanted to try Newman's own because it is organic and has all the good things a dog should have, and I felt he should be able to have something good for him other than meat.<br /><br />When Amazon offered this to me to review for all of you. I jumped at the chance for my dog to give it a try. When this arrived it came in a large bag, I thought this would have been a tiny little bag of treats, it was not,  the treats inside were very large 2-1/4"" long and about 2"" wide and about 1/2' thick. It also had a nice crease in the middle to brak it in half if  you choose to give a smaller treat. As most treats they smell awful but I guess a dog would like that.<br /><br />I gave my dog, a constantly hungry Black Pug, a choice of his frozen treat in one hand and Newman's own in the other, he took a while but chose his treat.<br /><br />I then gave him Newman's own treat and he took it but he sniffed at it for awhile.  Now he knows what it is. I then sat down at my laptop and he jumped up to be with me, he stared at the treat and I moved it toward him and nothing, I gave the OK command and he looked at it,  I had to pick it up and give it too him. Now it is a few minutes later, he is sitting here, the treat is on my leg and he is looking at it, oops just jumped off.<br />My dog, who will eat just about everything, just walked away from this treat.  He is not interested, I will not be buying this.  I will bring it to the shelter for another dog.",Neutral
"Little things to know - these biscuits are rock hard - if your dog has fragile teeth avoid them, if your dog devours everything in sight you might find they work.  They are about 1"" square and 1/4"" thick with a 2 biscuits stuck together - they even put a score line in the 2""x1"" pair so you can break them with your hand.<br /><br />They don't have a strong odor - in trainging my dog right now we've had several tests where we put down yummy treats and teach the dogs to walk in an oval avoiding the treats.  This particular one was ignored by all dogs - it doesn't smell good which seems to be the key to a treat working well - hot dogs were preferred 10/0 over these biscuits by the dogs in the class.<br /><br />I am presently training a purebread (3 generation 1/2 german 1/2 american) german shepherd dog and treats are an essential part of the process when your dog is food motivated.  The Lamb and Barley flavors don't really attract the attention of the dog when working with it and build attention span.  This dog is spoiled rotten getting a kong stuffed with peanut butter frozen overnight and fed GSD dog feed designed for the nutritional needs of a GSD.<br /><br />Training involves repeating the command and holding the treat in front of the dog's nose to get them to learn the commands - these worked the first time then not so well- I had to find something that smelt better as the dog would igore the treat.  Presently my dog is 6 months old and in a weekly training class with other dogs - we use chicken pieces, turkey pieces, and hot dog slugs to entise the dog into behaving well.  These were nowhere as motivating as the hot dog pieces which seemed to get the most attention.<br /><br />I am pleased that they are organic in nature but they lack a strong odor for the pet.  The pouch they come in is helpful to keep on your belt when training as well.  I don't see a real value in the product for dog training - they are almost too big for even big dogs, so hard to break they are pre-scored to 1x1, and just don't get the interest of the dogs - we tried a malamute, a husky, and my dog and they were only effective if the dog was really hungry!  Also the price is kinda high - I found a 10 pack of hotdogs next door for $2.50 which included a zipper pouch too.",Neutral
"My title says it all.  I appreciate the fact that these are built with nutrition in mind, but since my dog ONLY eats healthy dog food I'm not entirely concerned about a small, fun snack for him from time to time.<br /><br />At the sound of me saying ""treat!"" my dog almost looses his mind.  When I first gave him this he took it in his mouth, ran over to his treat-eating spot, and then dropped it and looked at it, not sure what to make of it.  After a while he bit into it (CRUUUUCH!) and ate the entire thing.<br /><br />I offered him another one the next day and he took it with a lot less enthusiasm than he usually does when taking treats.  It was almost as if he was saying, ""Well, if that is all I get I'll take it, but next time you say 'treat' it better be something I can get excited about.""  He ate it as well, but without the usual glee he puts into his treat-eating.<br /><br />So, he'll eat them but there are a host of other treats -- most of them also built with health in mind -- that he would prefer to eat first.  I'll still give him all of these square little biscuits from time to time but only because I don't want them to go to waste.  I won't be getting another bag.",Neutral
"I love everything I've ever tried from Newman's Own for myself and my favorite K-cup coffee is Newman's Own, so of course I just knew my treat loving dogs would love Newman's Own Dog Treats. Boy was I wrong. I had to go out for a few hours so gave each pooch a treat (the treats are rather large) and left. Normally the treats are swallowed so quickly I often wonder if they even taste them. But not these treats. After being away over 2 hours I came back to find both treats still there, still whole. So while I would give this product a 5 just knowing everything about it is the best - my pups give it a 1, hence the average of 3.<br />Both my pups are Maltese - 5 and 7 pounds and they may just be overly picky, but they are all I have to go by.",Neutral
"I was excited to be able to give these to my dog because he has tried and liked other Newman's Own Organics dog treats, like the cheese treats, so I figured he would enjoy these as well.  My dog is a Cockapoo and although he is generally not a picky eater, he likes some treats more than others.  (So far the Science Diet treats and Milkbones have not been winners.)<br /><br />My first impression was that I really liked the ingredients list.  Unlike a lot of dog treats, I actually understood and recognized all the ingredients and the fact that the ingredients were all organic were a plus.  Of course, I knew none of this would make a difference if my dog didn't like them.<br /><br />So what was the result?  Most of the time he really likes these treats, though he still prefers more of the jerky-style and chewy treats.  (I know this because there have been a few occasions when he has turned these treats down for whatever reason but will still gladly accept one of the others.)  Most of the time though he seems very happy to have one of these.<br /><br />Worth noting, these treats seem a little large for my 20-lb sized dog.  They can easily be broken in half, but breaking them in half again from there can be tricky.  Unlike some other large-sized treats he doesn't have a difficult time eating these, but boy are they crumbly.  Because he has to take several bites to eat one crumbs usually go everywhere.  He's a thorough eater so generally I haven't had a problem with a mess being left behind BUT I don't know that I would want him eating these treats on carpet or another surface where crumbs could get trapped.<br /><br />Overall, they are a good treat.  I appreciate the ingredient list and the fact my dog likes them, but wish they were a little smaller so he could eat them without them crumbling everywhere.",Neutral
"My mountain feist (a breed that is similar to a Jack Russell), an admittedly finicky eater, is no big fan of them. He will only eat the treats if they are mixed with canned dog food.  While it is good that the treats will be eaten and will not be wasted, mixing it with food seems to defeat the purpose of a treat.<br /><br />They are made of great ingredients and not made in China, which is a great thing if you are concerned about some of the junk that has been put into dog food as filler ingredients. I give it three stars because, despite my finicky dog's lack of a desire to snatch them from my hand, the treats smell good and this appears to be a trustworthy and relatively healthy offering.",Neutral
"These lamb and barley treats have some excellent features. I was impressed the certified organic ingredients, the re-sealable bag, and I like that they are large bones, but are scored so they can be broken in half. Left whole, the treats are good for large dogs, but when broken in half would be good for medium-sized dogs. They seem a bit too hard for small dogs.<br /><br />Our dogs usually like lamb flavored food, so this seemed like a good choice. We have three dogs and each had their own reaction to the treat. Our smallest dog, who usually likes anything, would barely sniff the treat and didn't even try to eat it. The middle-sized dog who is more picky wouldn't eat it at first. After playing with it for a few minutes, he finally did eat it. I'm assuming the smell wasn't appealing to him since it doesn't smell like a typical dog treat. Our dogs are used to a variety of store-bought and homemade dog treats. However, these organic treats smelled like hay to me (I'm assuming that's the barley), and therefore weren't very well received by two of my dogs.<br /><br />Our Golden Retriever likes most any treats and she ate this one without hesitation. While the treats might be great for some, since only one of our dogs will eat the treats regularly, I don't think they would be worth the extra cost for our household.",Neutral
"My dogs love Newman's the Chicken and the Peanut Butter treats, but didn't care for these treats.  They are about 1.5 inch square and very difficult to break in two.  I felt they were too big and solid to give to the dogs.  After several attempts to entice them with the treats and no happy response, I tossed them.  I will stick to the other Newman's treats.",Neutral
"Just a few observations here: 1) We have a small chihuahua. These are way too big for her. We basically have to crush them to crumbs for her to eat them. Otherwise she carries them and hides them like bones, and, trust me, it's no fun to find to find a slobbery lamb/barley biscuit under your pillow when you go to bed! 2) What the heck is barley doing in a dog treat? It doesn't seem to me that dogs were designed to graze in barley fields, so why are we feeding them barley? 3) My dog seemed to really enjoy the flavor, so these at least have that going for them.",Neutral
"I have a sprightly Yorkie who will eat just about anything...except these treats. But he sure loves to play with them, hiding them in blankets or tossing them around chasing it.

I do not know about large breeds but my smaller pups definitely had trouble nibbling them.",Neutral
"I have a chihuahua and while he did take this and try to eat it, it was just too big for his little mouth.  The treats are too hard to break into pieces and he wasn't all that interested enough to chew the bigger pieces.  Though I will have to say my dog has never been the dog biscuit type so that could be part of the reason he didn't enjoy it.  It's a good quality product made from great ingredients, but not every dog is going to like it obviously.",Neutral
"Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, 10-Ounce (Pack of 6) were not enthusiastically welcomed by our two dogs a terrier mutt and a German shepherd.  Both dogs were kind of suspicious when I handed them their Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Style Dog treats in their 10 ounce pack of 6.  Maybe the treats were too dry.  Later the dogs munched on them politely I think to not hurt my feelings.

"I have a Chihuahua that eats anything and everything- even things that are not supposed to be eaten.<br />When these treats came, she wanted them, she could smell them when the bag opened and was going crazy for them. I gave her a biscuit and she played with it for a couple minutes and tried to eat it but she couldnt- was too big and too hard. I could NOT break it into a smaller piece by hand, they are extremely hard. I left the treat out overnight and she left it alone. A friend brought their Doberman over and she ate the treat no problem.<br />I am rating these treats a 3 because my small dog couldnt eat them and there was no sizing info about the treat on the package and really if it wasnt for a friend having a dog the treats wouldve been trashed.",Neutral
"I have been looking for alternatives to made-in-China jerky. Because of - I presume - the amount of meat required to make real jerky, this has been a difficult endeavor. Even product lines like Milo's Kitchen source jerky from China while making the rest of their products - the ones they can process with fillers - in the US. True Chews markets US-made jerky treats but the meat is processed with other ingredients into a jerky-shaped chew that doesn't much resemble actual jerky.<br /><br />Likewise, when I received these treats they were not what I expected. ""Jerky,"" to my mind, means plain, dried meat. I thought the other mentioned ingredients would be added as a coating for flavor, but I expected a largely unprocessed product. In fact it is a cubed, compressed product containing significant amounts of grains and other ingredients as filler. My dog liked them but for the price there are other treats he likes better.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations of a treat labeled ""jerky"" are out of line, but I know a lot of people besides me are looking for a US-made jerky treat, and in my opinion this isn't it. On to Blue Buffalo Wilderness jerky. It is several times more expensive but so far the only ""real"" US-made jerky I have found.",Neutral

The taste is great but most of the crackers are broken.  I am maybe getting 12 whole crackers per box.  The first time I ordered these there were several broken but this time there are more broken than whole.,Neutral
I purchased these crackers from a local store for my 9 yr. old daughter who has celiac disease. She loves them but so many crackers were broken that they were mostly unusable for anything other than a bowl of pieces to snack on. I could only get about 3 cracker sandwiches out of the entire box. Glutino needs to fix this problem asap.,Neutral
"I picked up a couple of these while I was visiting my brother in LA. When I took my first bite, I thought, ""Hey, these kind of taste like a ritz cracker! Cool!""<br /><br />The second and third cracker though, I noticed a really starchy, floury taste coming through. I looked at the ingredients. Corn starch was the first ingredient.<br /><br />I tend not to like gluten free products made mostly from corn starch. They are light, sure, but kind of flavorless and powdery if you chew for any length of time.<br /><br />Brown rice flour or millet gives such a great depth of flavor, and it's an actual whole grain, not just a grain after all the protein and nutrients are taken out. Even white rice flour would be better.<br /><br />Corn starch, however is cheaper so I think that's why it gets used a lot.<br /><br />If you liked white flour, starchy foods before you went gluten free you might like these. If you prefer whole grains or even actual flour (not just the starch) I would try something else. I like Christie's multigrain crackers or brown rice thins.",Neutral
"There's not much taste to these, but they have a good texture and don't shatter when used for cheese and crackers or similar toppings.

We greatly prefer the Crunchmaster crackers for snacking without toppings and often use them for cheese and crackers even if they do break into little pieces because they're so tasty - but if you're annoyed by crumbly crackers that leave crumbs all over the place, I don't think you can do better than these Glutino crackers.<br /><br />And if you hate them, try crumbling them up and using them as a GF substitute for panko.",Neutral
"I like these crackers.  Or, at least I'd like to like these crackers.  They taste like ""normal"" crackers, and they crunch like ""normal"" crackers.  But they aren't ""normal"" crackers.  They're very fragile, and it doesn't help that they are packed in a foil bag rather than the sleeve-type packet common to ""normal"" crackers.  Most of these will be broken before they ever get to you.  My all-time high is four completely unbroken crackers in one box. A few are just broken in half but most are broken in many pieces.  Don't count on finding enough unbroken crackers to serve to guests.  It's a shame.  They could be good crackers, but this is too much to pay for cracker crumbs and pieces.",Neutral
Great taste for a glutin-free alternative. Still have some of the symptoms w/this as I do w/foods made from wheat flour. :(,Neutral

"These are the best glutin free ritz-like crackers...but that's not exactly a praise.  The cheese are not not bad, but the plain ones taste like egg.  A lot of gluten-free breads and crackers use egg as the lacking ""glue""...and you can always taste it.  Yuck! All of that being said, the plain ones are ok when made into peanut butter sandwiches and all of the crackers are pretty good with a dip or chicken/tuna salad...sigh.",Neutral
"One of the things I've really missed since going gluten-free are good crackers.  I've tried several brands.  None of them quite stack up to the real thing.  The Glutino crackers are slightly...soft.  They just don't have the crispness of regular crackers.  The flavors are okay, but, one thing that aggravates me most is that after paying A LOT of money for what looks like a substantial-sized box, one finds a pouch inside that contains very few crackers.  This deception seems to be rampant among most of the gluten-free cracker brands! (ie: Nut-Thins).  The best gluten-free crackers I've found so far are the brown rice crackers that come in a cellophane ""log""...at least you can see what you're getting for the money and they are crisp!  When I am desperate for something to put a slice of cheese or some dip or spread or whatever on, I'll slice a cucumber and use the cucumber slices as a cracker (a trick from my low-carb days).

I really like the product but this is the first and last time I'll order it. The box arrived with about 2 dozen of the single-serve containers busted ... a sticky mess to clean up.

I decided to take them all out of the box and rinse them under warm water. That has done the trick for the most part, and then I put them into a small wicker box (to be stored in my pantry).

However, for the hazelnut flavor, I do prefer the International Delight version over all everything else.<br />As for the packaging, like the other reviewers, there seemed to have been a leak in one of the cups and so a few of them were sticky and had a crust-like thing on them.

"i am constantly adding baby food to regular food [pumpkin, sweet potato into pancake mix; carrot, tomato, greens into spaghetti sauce; etc..].  so when i saw these i thought it would be a cool mix in without changing the consistency.<br /><br />tried the sweet potato into our pancake mix.  i couldn't taste them, nor did it change the color of the mix.  which for most older kids probably would be great.  however, my toddler calls them ""orange pancakes,"" so we ended up dumping in a jar of sweet potatoes anyway to make them orange.<br /><br />also added the carrots to a 4 cheese noodles i made.  it colored them great and you couldn't taste the carrots.  so if you are trying to be sneaky, then these will work, it's a very, very small amount of powder, so it'll boost the nutrition without being detected.  with that said...<br /><br />in wegmans where i live, they were 1.10 a pouch.  i didn't think that was bad considering the organic packets  [plum/happybaby] are anywhere from 1.00-1.50.  EXCEPT, that nurturme is equivalent to a 2.5 ounce jar, NOT the typical FOUR oz!  this is equal to those 1st stage baby food jars that are tiny.  their picture seems a little deceptive, because i think when most people see a pic of a baby food jar they think of the normal size ones- not the tiny ones.<br /><br />so in the end, you are paying more and getting less.<br /><br />like i said, i didn't buy these to mix up and feed my baby, i just wanted to try as a mix in.  in all, i think it's a cool concept, but as for paying double for the same product, ehh dunno.  might buy a pack and use it here and there as a mix in.",Neutral
"my son, who is six months old an a very avid eater of baby food (he generally eats whatever we put in his mouth with gusto) actually made an ""ick!"" face when i put the crisp apples mix in his mouth.  i think that's the first time i've ever seen him do that with a food.<br /><br />we tried both the crisp apples and the plump peas.  he ended up tolerating both (he definitely prefered the peas to the apples), but i tasted them myself, and, YUCK.  the plump peas taste like what they are...powdered.  they don't taste fresh at all.  the apples taste a bit better, but are kind of grainy and odd...and while i thought the sweet taste was OK, like i said, my son didn't seem to like it much at all.<br /><br />i wish we liked these better because i love the idea of a lightweight baby food that we could stash in our diaper bag that doesn't weigh much....too bad these aren't it.",Neutral
"My husband and I both tasted the peas today and they were delicious!  Huge step up over other baby foods we've tried!  Just wish there were more flavors to choose from...<br /><br />However, we've stopped buying this product based on Amazon's RIDICULOUS amount of packaging for it.  One of the reason I liked this product was that I felt greener using a baby food without the glass jars.  However, in order to ship 32 packets of powder, Amazon put the 4 small boxes of 8 powder packets into a bigger box, surrounded the bigger box with plastic padding, and put that box inside an even bigger box!  As if they were worried the powder packets would break?!  See the attached picture.  We bought it ~4 times and same over-kill packaging every time.  Even if you're not concerned about the environmental impact, it was annoying to break down and dispose of that much packaging just for a few things of baby food.",Neutral

"Out of curiosity, I chose to purchase this particular flavor of Two Leaves and a Bud at my local grocer.  I do not like the taste of the tea without sweetner -- it is very bitter even when using a lower temp for the water (because its green tea) and this is the first time I've ever tasted a green tea that I didn't care for -- The Two Leaves and a Bud Jasmine Green is divine!  With sweetener, the Orange Sencha Green is tolerable (for me).  What I like about this green tea is its medicinal effects.  On the back of all Two Leaves & A Bud packages are brief statements listing what types of foods the teas pair with and/or what the tea is ""best for.""  The Orange Sencha Green Tea states that it is best for concentration ... and it is.  If I'm feeling particulary foggy headed or out of sorts (lol), I drink a mug of Orange Sencha Green and it clears my head right up!  I appreciate teas that have effective medicinal qualities that are evident within a few sips and this makes up for the unpleasant (my opinion) taste.  I will continue to purchase it and would recommend it as a good reading or studying tea.",Neutral
"This is great sencha tea with just a hint of orange.  Being whole leaves rather than just the fines really makes a flavor difference - almost as good as brewing from bulk leaves and certainly more convenient.  It's too bad it's packaged in what appear to be nylon bags, however.  They do not seem to be readily decomposable - not a good thing since we try to compost and recycle everything we can.",Neutral
"The Galil Roasted Chestnuts are OK if you absolutely need a substitute for fresh chestnuts. I found that they were slightly mushy and didn't have the crunch of real chestnuts. I would use them again if, and only if, I couldn't get fresh and needed to make a specific recipe.",Neutral
"They were okay.  I can't rave about them or hate them, but having had them fresh from the shell, I can definitely tell the difference.  They don't have as much taste to them (they're rather bland, actually), and they're smaller than the fresh ones I've bought.  However, they're not bad-tasting, and you don't have to mess around with shelling them.  That's one thing that keeps me from getting fresh ones more than once or twice when they're in season!<br /><br />I don't think I would use these in a recipe unless I was in a pinch, because of the bland mushiness to them, but they're just fine for snacking.  I would recommend that you try these out if you see them in the store, and then if you like them go ahead and order the 24 pouch pack.<br /><br />Give them a try.  You might like them.",Neutral

I was really disappointed because the cracker was, even with the off taste, one of the best I have had Gluten Free.

I like supporting smaller family owned businesses and also the great prices on amazon but this syrup doesn't taste like maple at all to me. I might as well have bought generic corn-syrup based pancake syrup at the supermarket for $3. So I'll try a different brand next time.,Neutral

"The cover was slightly off tilt and the syrup leaked onto the bubble packing.  Packing was wound tightly around the container but does little for the cap not being tightened enough.  Container should have a foil safety shield installed which would end the leaking problem.  If my second auto-shipped one leaks, I will be cancelling the order.

Grade B is the healthy maple syrup, the REAL STUFF, and at first tastes a little darker than this and others you've had (which are almost surely the cheaper and more processed Grade A) but is far better for you and much healthier. If they can maintain this quality but offer a Grade B, we simply will NEVER get anther syrup brand again. As it is, we combine our Grade B which we get mail order from a place in Vermont right now with this since this has such a zesty taste to it.",Neutral

"Over the past year my wife has been pushing me (kicking & screaming) into a somewhat more healthy diet with the purpose of helping me lose weight and gain control of my cholesterol. Having me try a number of these fiber bar type things is one of the ways. For the most part I am not a big fan of them but am always on the lookout for one that will appeal to my fat/sugar-loving taste buds. Pamela's Whenever Bars is the latest of a long list of hopefuls.<br /><br />On the plus side; wheat-free, glutton-free, and non-dairy. They include Omega 3 fatty acids and no Trans fats. It's also low in sugar, low in sodium, and low in saturated fats. This is probably a good and quick snack for those with special dietary needs.<br /><br />On the negative site; the taste will be an acquired one, at least for me. It's not a bad taste by any stretch of the imagination but in my opinion it's not one I look forward to either. Maybe it's the lack of sweetness to the bar, or at least not enough sweetness that makes it more of a necessary snack instead of an attractive one. We'll see if it eventually grows on me.<br /><br />Overall, a decent and healthy snack that is not terrible tasting. Could be better but based on other bars I've tried, could be a lot worse.",Neutral
"PAMELA'S OAT CHOCOLATE CHIP COCONUT WHENEVER BAR, with a glass of cold skim milk, was my after-dinner dessert this evening. While it served its purpose as a cap to the evening meal quite nicely, it left me somewhat bemused.<br /><br />Not to put too fine a point on it, coconut was the only flavor discernable by me in the gustatory experience. Though obviously made with oats and containing chocolate chips, a taste of neither of those two ingredients came through.<br /><br />The ""mouth feel"" of the bar is pleasant enough. It's of medium density - as compared to the heavy density of a Bobo's Oat Bar (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZGW714"">Bobo's Oat Bars All Natural, Banana, 3-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a>) - and moist. Though the oat fiber is recognizably present in the texture, it's the flaked coconut that's most perceivable. The chocolate chips, while visible, contribute nothing at all in my opinion. (Again, if you're seeking a taste of oats, go to the Bobo's Oat Bar, which is very strong in that regard. If you're seeking the taste of chipped chocolate, don't dither about; go to a chocolate chip cookie, gluten-free if desired.)<br /><br />Pamela is apparently promoting an alternative snack for the nutritionally conscious and/or challenged as the packaging all but screams ""Wheat-Free"", ""Gluten-Free"" and ""Non-Dairy"", though the last claim is asterisked and clarified in the ingredients list with ""chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment.""<br /><br />The box also lists ""180 mg Omega 3 Fatty Acids"", ""9 Grams Whole Grains"" and ""0 Grams Trans Fats"", apparently for each 40 gram, 180 calorie, single-serving bar.<br /><br />To allow the buyers to feel altruistic when purchasing the product, it's also noted in the fine print that ""Pamela's Products donates to Celiac Sprue and Autism Support Organizations."" Celiac sprue is caused, of course, by dietary gluten intolerance.<br /><br />While I'd otherwise award at least 4 stars to this bar, I'm only going as high as three because the product's taste potential seems so badly misrepresented by its name. Unless you especially like coconut, you may do better seeking gratification elsewhere. And if you dislike coconut, definitely steer clear.",Neutral
"The bars are about 3/4th the size of a Clif bar and have the same sort of consistency. The smell of the coconut is pretty powerful when you open the package and the bars themselves don't really have a decent taste. I don't know if this is because it's gluten-free or what, but it tastes sort of like a dry tasteless oatmeal cookie. The chocolate didn't help add to the flavor. It's moist to the point where it feels damp and you can easily break it apart but I thought it was kind of bland and I felt like I needed to wash it down with lots of water.<br /><br />I'm a guy who likes snacks, and I'm a sucker for chocolate chip granola bars. This should be right up my alley. But it doesn't taste that great. If you're under certain dietary restrictions, you might feel differently but I wouldn't buy this as a snack.",Neutral
"I'm used to eating crispy and crunchy cereal/snack bars, so the Whenever bars were a surprise.  I still prefer a crunchy snack, but these are good for those who like their snacks soft.  They're not too dry, and many of the ingredients are organic.  You can see the chocolate chunks, but the overwhelming taste is coconut.  One family member said that she could taste the chocolate, and that it was moist--not like the dry bars.  It's not pretty, but it seems to be healthy.",Neutral
"This was not your usual granola bar looking snack.  It was somewhat misshapen making it look more home made.  It was soft which was a plus.  I liked the coconut.  My son, two of my grandchildren and my wife did not like the coconut.  On first glance it seemed yummy, what is not to like about oat, chocolate and coconut?  Obviously in my family the coconut was a negative.  Son liked the taste but not the coconut. Wife didn't like the taste and neither did the 5 & 7 year old grandchildren.  If you are looking for a gluten free non-dairy snack and have no issues with coconut or calories this is a good choice.  The 180 calories put it about 40 calories higher than our favorite granola bar and 80 calories higher than my favorite snack bar.  Uber-sensitive son was dismayed with the lack of protein and he was concerned about the 9grams of fat.<br /><br />Wrapping it up, for a gluten free snack it is pretty good but if you are not concerned about gluten you probably will want a different snack.<br /><br />Addendum:the counter woman at my favorite pizza place is on a gluten free diet and loved them.  So that confirms it, as a gluten free snack it got the prize!",Neutral
"These bars by Pamela's Products are OK.  They are very chewy and moist.  Also very stick-to-your-teeth.  However, taste is limited.  There is a general bland undertone, overall, but somewhat heavy on the oat flavor also with a bit of a coconut undertone.  There is no noticeable chocolate taste (to me).  However, the chips' soft slick variance from the other chewiness is obvious.<br /><br />Bars (of any kind) can be very personal to folks in taste (like or dislike).  Try and see for yourself.",Neutral
"This product has many claims, making it appear healthy. A quick look at the nutritional information, however, shows somewhat otherwise. Each bar is 180 calories, which is a good mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. Total fat, though, is 9g, with 2g saturated fat. Fortunately, it provides 2g of fiber and 2g of protein. Everybody's needs are different, but this product is just outside my range of what I consider a ""healthy snack"".<br /><br />Most of the ingredients are ""organic"", which is a plus. They are also sweetened with agave and coconut sugar. However, for my personal taste -- and I have quite a sweet-tooth -- this product is too sweet for me. Perhaps it's the chocolate, or one of the other sweetening ingredients, but by the time I finish the bar, I'm reaching for something to drink to cut the sweetness. The benefit of this is that the bar is a good candy-substitute if you are craving a sweet treat in the afternoon hours.<br /><br />The texture is good -- this bar is like a heavy oatmeal cookie. There's nothing hard or crunchy in it. It's very soft and chewy.<br /><br />If it weren't for what I characterize as an extreme sweetness, I could give this product a higher rating.",Neutral
"There are many other reviews that go into great detail regarding calories, ingredients etc.  I will not repeat that info here, but will limit my comments to taste/value/""worth it"" factor.<br />I thought these tasted just ok.  They would never be my first or second tier pick for a snack.  They are too small for meal substitute and contain too many calories for a snack for anyone watching weight.  I found the mouth feel of these to be unpleasant.  The taste is ok...none of the individual ingredients shine.<br />p.s. Someone with a chip on their shoulder has gone through the reviews for this product and given almost everyone of them an unhelpful feedback--and this includes a huge variety of detailed reviews.  I like to believe this is not someone from Pamelas as they are a good and reputable copany.

"This is a tough product for me to review because at first taste I thought, ""hey these aren't too bad,"" but the second time around I thought, ""these are not good!"" and then the third time I thought, ""there're not as bad as I thought they were last time.""  Hmmm.  So my conclusion is they're not too bad, but not that good either.  Each bar comes in an individual package and tastes pretty fresh.  The bars are kind of mushy, with a non-descript brownish color and soft rectangular shape.  I don't know that I really tasted much coconut flavor, and the chocolate chips certainly gave it a boost in taste.  I would not buy these or eat them as snacks, but I do not typically buy snack bars or power bars because on the whole I don't find them all that appealing.  I am always willing to give these types of bars a chance and would LOVE to be won over, but unfortunately these ones didn't do it for me.",Neutral

It will never beat a Ring-Ding, but it probably won't kill you as fast. One of my kids likes them, the other doesn't.<br /><br />I think they're OK. They have that weird aftertaste that all soft-bars, like Luna bars, seem to have. There could be a lot more coconut and chocolate for my taste.<br /><br />The nice thing about these puppies is that they are gluten-free for those who care. They are a good size to cram into a bag, though they'll crumble if you push them into a pocket.",Neutral
"These bars have a very good, chewy texture that's enhanced by the chocolate chips. Since they only have 2 grams of protein in a 40 gram bar, I wouldn't consider them a meal replacement, but if you're looking for a gluten-free snack, these soft cookie bars might fit the bill.",Neutral

"My husband is the driving force of healthiness in our household and insists we eat as clean and organic as possible. Normally this kind of snack would be right up his alley, which is why I got them. But he didn't care for the taste. He told me they were alright but kind of plain and told me not to get them again as there are tastier snack options out there for his packed lunches. Saying that, I have to also mention that he either ate the whole box over time or he threw them out because they weren't in the snack drawer the other week when I cleaned it out.",Neutral
"These taste really good, and they are moderately low-calorie. They are also wheat-, dairy-, and gluten-free, which is wonderful for those with allergies.  Unfortunately, I could probably eat all of them in a single sitting; they are smaller than the average bar! Of the 180 calories per bar, 80 of those calories are from saturated fats. In the list of ingredients it states ""chunks may contain traces of milk protein due to manufacturing equipment.""  I'm not sure what that could mean to someone who is allergic to milk, but I probably would not want to take any chances.  The normal retail price of a package of 5 Whenever Bars hovers around $3.90.  Even at the Amazon.com price, a 6-pack (total 30 bars) would cost $19.62, which breaks down to $3.27 for 5 bars<br />When this package is empty, I am not likely to buy more.",Neutral
"These are the oat chocolate chip coconut bars. These are a soft, cookie-like bar that is wheat and gluten free and have no dairy in them. They also have Omega 3 fatty acids, whole grains, and no trans fats.<br /><br />The bars taste pretty good, although I couldn't really taste the coconut in them. They had a hint of chocolate without being overpowering. The oats were a rolled oats but it was not over powering like some granola bars. The bar is about two inches by three inches and a prefect little snack.<br /><br />On the downside, the bars are really crumbly, almost like there is nothing really holding them together. Because of that, I had to keep them in a container to carry them in my munchie bag.  The bars are real small and are 180 calories. And finally, for five bars, the regular price on Amazon is listed as $30 but they are now discounted to $24.<br /><br />Although they might taste good, I will not be buying these. That is way too much money for three or four bites of a very crumbly cookie.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.",Neutral
"These weren't awful, they just weren't good. The combination of flavors is actually nice because you can't go wrong without chocolate and coconut, but the texture just ruins it all. I do understand that often gluten free baking has its obstacles to overcome, but these bars feel like they want to be cake-like but wind up powdery and almost tough at the same time. Basically, they have the sort of texture one imagines a ""gluten free"" product would have (although it doesn't have to be this way!) And while I love almonds, their presence only adds to the unpleasant feeling this bar has in the mouth.<br />Luckily, I'm not gluten free, but if I were I imagine these would be nice in a pinch though I wouldn't seek them out just to have around.",Neutral
"Well, hubby liked these and I did not.  He liked the variety of ""stuff"" in them--oats, choc. chips, coconut.  I thought they were a bit dry.  They are deceptively packaged.  Each box has 5 bars in packaging that is about twice the size of the actual bar. I anticipated that these might be a healthier choice but, after reading the ingredient panel, was disappointed.  These have as much junk in them as other bars on the market.  If you are in need of gluten-free products then I guess this is a good choice for you but,if not, I recommend looking elsewhere.",Neutral
"I have a confession to make:  I had one of these bars and a cup of coffee for breakfast, and it was actually not bad.  But the Amazon stars say ""I love it"" for 5 stars, ""I like it"" for 4 stars and ""It's okay"" for 3 stars.  So, I give it 3 stars.  I personally felt the coconut flavor was stronger than the chocolate flavor and I'm not a big coconut fan, but I am a chocolate fan.  It wasn't terribly sweet and I rather think I would have liked it a little better if it had been sweeter (but not too sweet - I'm kind of picky that way).  I liked the oats and the ""gluten free""-ness of it.  I don't eat gluten, so that makes bread/bagels pretty expensive.  These worked out best for breakfast, although I think I used it as a going to bed snack a couple of times.<br /><br />So, just for fun, I got some nutritional information from 1) Pamela's Oat Chocolate Chip bars 2) some unsalted, dry roasted peanuts and 3) some non-gluten gingersnaps.<br /><br />1) 1, 1.41 oz bar  -had 9g fat, 15 mg cholesterol, 130 mg sodium and 2g of protein.<br />2) 1 oz (40 nuts)  -had 14g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 0mg sodium and 7g protein.<br />3) 5 cookies (30g or 1.06 oz)  -had 6g fat, 0mg cholesterol, 85 mg sodium and 2g protein.<br /><br />I think that each of these snacks might serve at one point or another.  If you are looking for high protein, then neither the cookies or the Pamela's bars would do the trick, confirming that the Pamela's bars would be more of a snack than a meal.  So don't eat one of these with coffee for breakfast.  Ever.",Neutral
"I like this bar because it is healthy without tasting blah! It's nicely chewy and not as dry or tasteless as some ""health"" bars tend to be.  A nice combination of grains, coconut and chocolate make this a bar to reach for if you want a quick, easily packable snack that is not unhealthy. With that said, the calories are rather high: 180, and it includes 9 grams of fat, so you couldn't really call it a low-cal snack. I've often had one for breakfast as a kind of meal replacement when I'm in a hurry, with a glass of OJ and felt it satisfied me for a few hours, until lunch time. I like that it's gluten free, even though I don't actually have a gluten allergy that I know of.  But I think it's great that those who do have gluten intolerance are getting more and more choices.Bottom line: this is a nice snack, fairly healthy, and not a bad choice as a quick meal substitute.",Neutral
"I was a little skeptical when ordering this product. With everything it had going for it I figured there had to be a catch. Wheat-Free, Gluten-free, Non-Dairy - I wasn't expecting much in the way of flavor. I was pleasantly surprised that, while it seems subdued, there is flavor and it's alright. I can taste the chocolate & the coconut predominately. As it states on the box, they are ""moist & chewy"". I wasn't a fan of the texture at first but by the time I got to the 3rd bar it was fine.<br /><br />What I didn't like is that one bar has 180 calories (80 of which come from fat). So much for a healthy ""whenever"" bar.<br /><br />15mg of Cholesterol, 130mg of sodium (yikes), 23g Total Carbohydrates, 2g of dietary fiber, 8g of sugar, 2g of protein.<br /><br />It also states that there are 180mg Omega 3 fatty acids, 9 grams of whole grains, & 0 grams trans fats.<br /><br />The numbers above are for 1 bar which = 1 serving.<br /><br />This product contains coconut, eggs, soy, and almonds. It is processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy, and milk.<br /><br />So this isn't something I would personally chose to get again. They're alright in terms of flavor but they just seem to have too much of a downside when inspecting the label.",Neutral
"Yes, tasty -- but it takes a little getting used-to.  You have to like coconut to like this snack item.  That taste quite overwhelmed all else, for me.

i got this tea hoping it would be better than my dieters delight china slim tea but it isnt. it does make you use the bathroom but not enough for you to feel cleansed for that particular day...i have no choice but to finish thus package but i will be going back to my regular tea afterwards,Neutral
This tea is ok but it's not nearly as potent as the original product that was available 5-10? Years ago.,Neutral
"Mostly bought this tea assortment for the Chocolate Mint flavor, which has been disappointing. Has a fake chocolate taste. The only other flavors I've tried are Coconut Mango and White Peach. The White Peach is very good, while Coconut Mango is okay. I hope the other 3 flavors are better, otherwise I would say this 6-pack is a waste, which is a shame because I normally enjoy Stash teas.",Neutral
"I ordered these after I bought the Stonewall Kitchen gluten free chocolate chip cookie mix.  I was so happy to find something like this for my 7 year old!  Unfortunately, the cupcakes were really - icky.  They tasted like corn muffins.  My son is gluten free due to sensitivity, not a disease.  Therefore he does not have to be 100% gluten free.  This makes our choices a bit wider when I am looking at ingredients for him.  The chocolate chip cookies were very good and I'd buy the mix again and make them.  I bought both the chocolate and vanilla cupcake mix.  We found them heavy, and didn't really like the taste.  They were totally disappointing.  I can now go to Hannafords and buy pre made gluten free cupcakes that are actually yummy - they are also a bit heavy.  They don't taste like corn bread and that is the plus.  My suggestion if you order these is make them mini cupcakes and make or buy your own frosting.  For someone who is gluten free, they do taste better than lots of things you can buy and make.  For kids who aren't - they will notice a big difference and most likely not like or want them.",Neutral
"The oatmeal itself is tasty and pretty healthful.  It's not the best oatmeal I've ever had, but it is quite good.  And it is great to see yet another vegan-certified product on the market.  This is a great option for busy vegans (like me!) looking for a quick breakfast.  You can probably make better oatmeal from scratch, but it would take a lot longer.  So, really, this is a good product.<br /><br />But I have two (somewhat related) complaints.<br /><br />First, the serving size is *ridiculously* small.  Each packet of oatmeal is about 120 calories.  That's just silly.  Unless you're a child, or you're planning on eating much more than oatmeal for breakfast (or adding significant quantities of fruit to your oatmeal), you'll want to open a couple of packs each time you sit down.  That's a bit annoying.  (You could solve this one problem by buying the larger cups.  But they're a much worse value, calorie-for-dollar.  And the second problem, below, still applies.)<br /><br />Second, there is so much packaging and unnecessary waste.  It's absurd that ~50 ounces of oatmeal is spread out over six boxes, each of which contains eight microscopic paper bags of oatmeal.<br /><br />These problems could be solved by just selling single-container bags of oatmeal.  The result would be less waste and packaging and an easier time serving.<br /><br />Still, overall, this is a good product.",Neutral
"I like the generous serving of real apples in this oatmeal. However, one packet does not have enough oatmeal for a hearty breakfast. Two packets at a time work best. Not very creamy, which was sort of a bummer, so you really need 2 packets.  but an ok instant cereal.",Neutral
I bought 21 0z freeze dried liver. Half the container was filled with powder instead of pieces/chunks. I feel I was betrayed by the company. Hence I did not get what I paid for,Neutral
Dogs love these things but `I do feel they are overpriced for the quantity you get.,Neutral
"My dog enjoys these treats in moderation.  Because they are dried, he seems to enjoy them less the more he eats them.  With water, the treats may be much more flavorful.  After having a fair amount, he starts to lose interest in them until he can drink.<br /><br />This brings me to a question regarding serving size.  The container recommends 2-3 cubes per day for a medium breed.  The issue I'm having is that the size of the cubes is so very inconsistent.  Some bits are the size of a pea while others of a grape.  The rest are a variety of sizes in between.  Some consistency would be preferred.<br /><br />Also, this product comes highly recommended for training because it is low in fat.  My dog certainly won't learn anything with just 2-3 of these per day.  Like most dogs, he is highly motivated by food so 20-30 treats is more accurate.  To make this possible, I have to dice them up into smaller pieces or shift through to find the little bits.<br /><br />At least these treats are natural and thus healthier than some of the other options.  I just didn't expect to have to prepare them first.",Neutral
"These are great training treats when you need something lightweight that won't make a mess of your pockets. I have a couple problems with them though. First, they are too expensive for every day training. Second, the sizes are so inconsistent that you need to cut some of the large cubes up (at this price, they should be ready-to-eat). Actually there is a third, which is that the powder leftover on the bottom is useless to me.<br /><br />I've found it much cheaper to just put some sliced beef liver from the store in the oven and bake till dry. Cut it up, put it in small portions, and freeze. My dog likes it better than the freeze-dried anyway. I do a whole bunch at a time so I am not prepping frequently. But I figure if I have to prep something, it might as well be something cheap!",Neutral
"This product is very expensive but my dogs love them. I can get them to do what ever I want as long as they know they are getting these as a reward but then again, I can also use cheap hot dogs with the same results. If you have money to burn, then buy this, if not, stick with store brand hot dogs cut up into small pieces.",Neutral
"I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them. The sizes are quite variable which is ok.<br /><br />The product arrived with no protective covering on either the outside of the tub or under the lid which bothered me a bit (not sure if they had been open, returned by someone, then sent to us) so that is why I rated 3 stars.<br /><br />The amount of product for the price is great!<br />I would most likely purchase again.",Neutral
"This is more like a flavored spread than a true mayo replacement, I would not advise using it in Potato salad or tuna fish. It is very tasty as a veggie dip and as an admittedly rich burrito topping.",Neutral
Bought this and the regular for a friend's birthday present. Purchased the 3 pack - My friend saw a review of this on Oprah - Can't find it in stores... so I tried this - It is a bit strong - had to mix in more light mayo with it... I am waiting for my tomatoes to come in for a Tomato and Baconnaise sandwich - that will be the TRUE TEST!!<br />So far my review is this - Not bad -but it is strong. You may have to mix it with more mayo like I did.,Neutral
"We wanted the Baconnaise lite after seeing the product on Oprah. We looked forward eagerly to the  prospect of that great bacon taste. The decision in our house was 1 for and 1 not so.<br />The taste is there, the ""greasy"" taste was also. I won't buy the product again.",Neutral
"I give this 3 stars because it wasn't unpleasant coffee.  It just didn't taste like anything.  It reminded me of hot water with those Folgers coffee bags dunked in it for a little bit.  I don't like too strong a coffee but this was way underpowered for coffee.  I enjoy the bolder coffees, too, such as Coffee People Organic Bold and Dark Magic.  I would not buy Nantucket again.",Neutral

"I enjoy starting the day with a cup of coffee. Once upon a time, I just used instant. Some were decent quality; some weren't. Then, I tried Mr. Coffee. Sorry, not my cuppa! Back to instant. Maxwell House had some nice instant.<br /><br />But my family wanted a Keurig coffee maker, so--for the holidays this year--I bought one. The coffee that came with it was a Newman's Own blend. Pretty bold and tasty (better than instant and quite a bit better than my memory of Mr. Coffee). I recently ordered this through Amazon. It is not quite as bold as the Newman's Own k-cup coffee. But it does have a smooth taste that starts the day off nicely. So, I have encountered two good coffees for the Keurig coffee maker!",Neutral
Ordered this product without reading what i was getting ... dumb on my part.<br />My wife loves Nantucket Blend.  I mistakenly thought this was for 2 boxes of 24 k-cups because of the price.<br />Much cheaper to pick this great product up at Kohls or Bed Bath and Beyond if you have access to them.,Neutral

"But not great.  I will agree their taste can be a bit much, think of a garlicky artificial taste that would be on chips.  To be honest, this defeats the purpose of a roasted walnut, where you would think its roasted and perhaps has salt on them.  Granted these aren't awful, but after eating a container I'm not really sure if I would consider them good.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- One of the few ""roasted"" walnut options I've seen<br />- The taste is ok, but not great<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- These do not taste like the walnuts found in Emerald's deluxe mixed nuts canisters, if thats what you are looking for<br />- The taste can be a bit much, its ok, but if you are looking for a plain roasted walnut this isn't it<br />- Not to nitpick but these are mostly walnut pieces, not many whole walnuts<br /><br />Recommendation:<br /><br />- I don't think I would get them again<br />- I would suggest not buying a 6 pack until you try them first because they aren't just simple roasted walnuts",Neutral
"Ok, straight up--these things taste funky.  My first thought when I ate the first walnut was, ""What am I going to do with 6 canisters of these weird things?""  My wife tried one and hated it--she refuses to eat them.  But I kept trying them and began to like them (probably because I didn't want to feel I was throwing $30 down the toilet).  I can't quite give them 4 stars, because they're not THAT great.  But I sometimes have a hard time stopping myself from eating them once I start.<br /><br />It would really be cool if Emerald could duplicate the taste that Blue Diamond has accomplished for their Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds.  Now THOSE things are awesome!  I highly recommend those, even if you're not a big fan of almonds.  I'm doubtful, however, that I'll order these walnuts again.",Neutral
"I'd give this 5 stars if they'd leave the seasoning out of the can - I'm not going to eat 4 tablespoons of seasoning! So I don't want to pay for it (you're paying by the ounce) and I certainly don't want to sift through the seasoning to get all the little pieces out of it at the end. Overall - they taste excellent, they are very light & crunch & the seasoning does taste good, if only there wasn't so much of it.",Neutral
"I first bought this brand of walnuts at my local store and loved them. They were fresh, crispy and had a hint of spice on them taht made them a tastey snack. I am trying to reduce my cholesterol and walnuts have the correct oils that help with this. So I bought a couple cases of these from Amazon. The nuts I recieved are just as fresh and crispy, but the spices on these containers for some reason are almost overwhelming. There are many nuts in the package that are caked with the mix of garlic, onion paprika, etc..., so much to the point that I have now taken to rinsing them off. This makes them a big soggy.., None the less, they are still a good value compared to the store prices, and you can rinse them , use them in recipes and they take just fine. Wish that they weren't so overpowering, so that I could snack on them right out of the container.",Neutral
"Did not come super fast, packaged was smashed but the turtles inside were not damaged. Box was decorated for Christmas which perhaps the 'ad' for them said that, but I didnt' realize that since they were a birthday gift. Maybe I missed the fine print! Tasted fine, were a hit!",Neutral
Not sure this was worth the effort.  Not the sellers fault - Just not worth the trouble.,Neutral
"If you enjoy the taste of Bacon, you may like these. If you're looking for the SW Ranch flavor indicated, expect Bacon flavor instead.  They have a nice crisp texture that's satisfying. I personally don't care for bacon flavored anything, so was disappointed to find South West Ranch flavor MIA. I tried & do like the plain sea-salt flavor.",Neutral
"Love these crackers.  They're very satisfying without being too salty or sweet.  Unfortunately a large number of crackers were broken in each package.  Based on the packaging.......crackers in a row in light cardstock box wrapped in cellophane.....it's probably not possible to ship without alot of breakage. For this reason, I probably won't order this item online again.",Neutral
"One bowl (2 servings) makes a filling lunch for one.  The highly spiced chicken flavoring (definitely not for wimps!) is quite tasty.  The extra-long, curly noodles are delicious.  There are no vegetable or chicken bits in the bowl--the ones shown on the package label are apparently garnishes added for the photo shoot.  The ingredients list reveals more beef flavorings than chicken flavorings.<br /><br />The food prep couldn't be easier: (1) pull back the cover, (2) open the seasonings packet and dump it in, (3) fill the bowl with room temperature water, (4) microwave for 3 minutes, and (5) let cool for at least one minute before eating.  One is wise to heed the instructions to wait a bit before eating--my microwaved noodles were still too hot to eat after three or four minutes.  The bowl can also be prepared by adding hot water and letting the mixture steep for three minutes.<br /><br />Unfortunately,  the 2-serving bowl--and who eats only half a bowl of noodles?--delivers a whopping 1780 mg of sodium, even though this particular product has 30% less sodium than the manufacturer's regular product.  The FDA recommended daily intake for sodium is about 2300 mg of sodium, so if you eat the whole bowl, you have consumed about 77% of your day's recommended sodium.  (The package label is reasonably honest, stating that 1 serving delivers 37% of your daily sodium.)<br /><br />Because my diet is generally a low-salt one (by choice, not for medical reasons), I could tell that some of the spicy flavor was coming from salt rather than from other seasonings.  However, the product did not make me immediately thirsty, as most high-salt commercial food products do.  For me, this product is worth only three stars (""it's okay""), because I can't eat it on a regular basis and still keep my salt intake down.  That's too bad, because a product like this is great to have on the pantry shelf to pull out for a quick meal.",Neutral
"First off, as of this writing, this product is not actually for sale on this page. But it is for sale here: [...]<br /><br />Just had a bowl of these for lunch. I'm not a huge eater, and found the volume of this to be okay. I'm glad I brought some corn chips to supplement (I know, not the best combo). The taste was okay too, though not, in my mind, much better than most ramen or Cup o Noodles or Maruchan type things. Really, it was like a squirt of sriracha in a cup of chicken ramen. Which is fine. Good. And this doesn't have MSG, so that's nice, and it comes in a bowl, so that's nice. There are flakes of veggies, and a couple pea-sized chunks of very spongy chicken. It took me a while to realize that the spongy stuff was chicken. Seems about right for this kind of product.<br /><br />I can't leave the office for lunch, so I'm always looking for something I can tuck in a desk drawer and actually enjoy. Given that it is in a microwaveable (non-styrofoam) bowl, and I like the idea of squirting sriracha in my ramen, this is a good option. Given how infrequently I'll use them, though, I might splurge and go for a much more expensive but slightly more gourmet bowl of noodles (Annie Chun, etc). On the other hand, if I were going to eat them more frequently, I might want to splurge and go for a more expensive but healthier alternative.<br /><br />If cheap, easy, and basically tasty are your priorities, this is probably a good option. If you want to throw healthy or interesting into the mix, I think you're going to have to spend a little more.",Neutral
"Got the Spicy Chicken from the grocery store. It was sitting right there, buried by Top Ramen and Maruchan. I wanted the Shin Noodle but was not there. The positive notes about this noodle bowl; Not too salty and the broth is worth drinking at the end. Cons; The noodles aren't that different from those other brands. For more then 3x the price, i was expecting better noodles. Also it's really not that spicy. Extremely mild, good spice level for kids.",Neutral
"I've been a fan of Nong Shim spicy noodles for years, so when this instant version came along I had to try it. I love Korean style fat noodles and the fact that it's instant is a big plus. Unfortunately, it didn't taste as flavorful as their other lines and by comparison I find this version a little plain. No comments on the health factor since instant noodles by nature is junk food. But there's a time and place for them.",Neutral
"Ramen cups (or bowls, in this case) are a guilty pleasure. I enjoy a Nissin or a Maruchan from time to time, but I know before adding the water that I'm not going to get a healthful snack. For that reason, I don't assess any star penalty for the nutritional transgressions that will be committed when one of these is consumed. They are what they are. You want healthy, eat a salad.<br /><br />Speaking of healthy, the Nongshim bowl proudly proclaims that it has 30% less sodium than their regular product and no MSG. But if you eat the whole thing you'll still be getting about 3/4 of your daily allotment of sodium (assuming a 2000 calorie diet) as well as artificial flavor and the usual cast of chemical names. As I mentioned, you would assume this much unless you just fell off a potato truck.<br /><br />All that said, I just didn't care for the Nongshim very much. I like spicy but I didn't find it all that flavorful beyond the spice heat. My 3-star rating is based solely on that. If sodium and healthy eating are concerns, you can work your way down the star scale from there.",Neutral
"I used the full packet of seasoning mix and I though the broth had much more depth of flavor than most noodle cup type meals with distinguishable notes of lemongrass and ginger. I would rate the heat level at medium with a pleasant tingly mouth burn. Less salty but still plenty of sodium, there is plenty of broth so this would be a good one to use as a base with added vegetables and meat. Weak points are the dehydrated chicken and vegetables that have a distinctive dehydrated flavor.",Neutral
"These are just ramen noodles in a convenient microwavable cup. Noodles, a smattering of dried veggies and TVP, and a salt...I mean flavor packet. Prep is stupid easy...open the foil lid, add the contents of the flavor packet, add water to the line, fold the lid back down, nuke for three minutes, stir, and enjoy.<br /><br />The results are just what you would expect from a bowl of ramen. Lots of noodles and broth, and there at the bottom of the bowl, are a few vegetable bits and some tiny cubes of textured soy protein that is supposed to pass for chicken. The flavor is just about what you would expect from a chicken flavored soup, but with a nice spicy kick on the back of the throat. That spiciness stays pleasantly on the lips for a few minutes after.<br /><br />So what's not to like? Even if you aren't watching your sodium intake, this is a salt lick in a bowl. Even if you follow the ""serving guidelines"" on the nutrition facts panel and share this with a friend or loved one (Yeah, right!), you get over one third of your daily salt intake. If you are like most of us and hog all 3 oz. yourself, your sodium intake will be a whopping 74% of the daily recommended maximum.<br /><br />The price is also a bit steep for a ramen product. Overall it is not enough new and different from the ramen in the cello wrap for me to purchase this.",Neutral

"Not a pudding by American standards.  But then again, the name itself is somewhat obscene by American standards.

Overall this dick wasn't particularly good or bad but it isn't something I will be rushing to eat again. It's a bland, spongy cake with fruit in it and it didn't taste particularly bad or good.<br /><br />The can is good for a laugh if you are a slightly (ME!) immature American!

Most food products, especially candy, is a rip-off from most Amazon sellers. However, the cereal is usually cheap. I think the 11.5oz was about $2.60 at Wal-Mart, but I paid  only $6.86 for the 1 package of 3 boxes here on Amazon, so that is about $2.29 for each box. That was a good deal, but now the page says $15 for 3 boxes, which is $5 a box. That is a rip for the 11.5oz box; you can get a 16oz box for only about $3.00 at Wal-Mart. So you have to watch the prices to see if it's cheaper or not.<br /><br />I was worried about the cereal not being fresh, but it is. My Lucky Charms were the new ones with the new marshmallows in them; currently it's the different colors of shooting stars. My boxes from Amazon have the same expiration date as the Frosted Flakes I bought at Wal-Mart, so that's a good thing. They taste good too (just in case there is other problems that could be wrong with them).<br /><br />So overall, check the prices to see if it is worth it, the prices change both in the store and online, alot (mostly they change online, though). I bought from here like a month ago, but wouldn't buy them this second, probably would, again, in the future, though.",Neutral
"I'm not a fan of fruit flavored sodas, usually I find them to be too sweet. Thankfully this wasn't overly sweet, but I still don't think it's something I would drink on a regular basis. I tend to prefer my fruit drinks to just be the fruit juice. I don't need the added carbonation added to the drink.",Neutral
"This Switch Kiwi Berry drink comes is as great, easy to handle, streamlined candy.  However, it does delivery an intense, fruit, flavor.  Great when you really need a sweet fruit recovery from a hot summer day.  Otherwise, a bit overpowering. A nice treat though.",Neutral
"I tried the Switch Kiwi Berry drink along with the Switch Black Cherry drink.  I'll review them together because there isn't that much to write about.<br /><br />First, I'll admit a little bias.  I'm not a fan of sugar-based drinks.  I drink diet pop, Crystal Light drinks, and I use saccharin, aspartame, and sucralose.  I find sugar-based drinks generally ""gummy"", although carbonated drinks are somewhat preferable to non-carbonated drinks.  While there is ""no sugar added"" to these drinks, the fruit juice itself is quite full of sugar.<br /><br />The Switch brand drinks are lightly carbonated, which helps them in my opinion - others may disagree.  The gumminess is still there, though.  The fruit flavor is not strong enough to overcome this and I found that I needed this drink to be extremely cold (as in near frozen) to enjoy it.  I did not like the aluminum can for this product either.  I find that fruit-flavored drinks seem to latch onto the aluminum flavor more than other drinks.<br /><br />My personal preference was for the Black Cherry, but others may like the Kiwi Berry.  I can't recommend this as a net positive, but my preferences might adversely reflect here - I'll rate it as neutral.  If you feel your tastes are similar to mine, you should probably forgo this one.",Neutral
"Switch, with it's 100% RDA of Vitamin C, and it's lack of added sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives, is not only healthy, but it has the nice twist of carbonation to appeal to soda drinkers young and old.<br /><br />This is a great beverage for soda-lovers--children and adults alike, as well as for health foodies looking for something a little different. It's an especially great product for kids, because they think they are getting soda, but it's really just fancy juice that's (GULP!) good for them!<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry flavor is sweet, but it's a natural flavor that derives its sweetness from fruit juices. Overall, it's definitely an enjoyable product.",Neutral
"If giving your kids, or yourself, carbonated juice gets them (or you) to drink more juice and less soda, that's good.  But the taste of this is similar to the juice in juice boxes.  It's a blend of juices with a fruit punch type of flavor.  It's also quite pricey.  Interesting once, but I won't be buying more.",Neutral
"Last year I tasted several of the Izze fruit drinks for the first time and became addicted.  I have an affinity for fruity foods and beverages, and that fact combined with my positive experiences with Izze prompted me to try THE SWITCH.<br /><br />I'll say it right off the bat - THE SWITCH was okay, but it doesn't really compare in taste to Izze.  If I had never tasted Izze, I might enjoy THE SWITCH more.  As it is, I thought it was tasty enough, but I wouldn't drive out of my way to get it.  If I were in the convenience store looking for a refreshing fruity beverage, I might buy it again.<br /><br />I tried two different flavors of THE SWITCH, and the Kiwi Berry was my least favorite of the two flavors (the other was Black Cherry).  The kiwi berry flavor was nice, but a little bit muddled for me.  However, the fruit flavors did taste natural - I just think I would have preferred a simple Kiwi flavor instead of the blend.<br /><br />To sum up, I think THE SWITCH is a nice alternative to sodas, although a little pricier than colas are.  It is a refreshing fruit beverage, but there are other brands that have a tastier flavor.<br /><br />If Amazon allowed half-star ratings, I would give this 3.5 stars.",Neutral
"I tried this after reviewing another Switch product (the black cherry flavor). The Kiwi Berry is also tasty, though for the life of me I couldn't taste the kiwi -- just strawberry.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry has the same problem as the Black Cherry, however; just SO much sugar! Ounce for ounce, it's as much sugar as in a regular, non-diet soda. I'd definitely drink any of the Switch products again ... but I won't try to convince myself it's a health drink!",Neutral
"I decided to try the Switch Kiwi Berry drink because I'm trying to find tasty alternatives to regular cola and I don't like most artificially sweetened drinks. Switch did a great job with the kiwi and strawberry flavor of this beverage, but I can't shake the feeling that it's a drink that is pretending to be healthy even when it's not.<br /><br />The Switch can states this drink is made with 100% Juice, all natural, with no sugar added and no corn syrup. That must make it healthy, right? Wrong. This tiny 8.3 ounce can packs 135 calories and 33 grams of sugar! How is that possible? Switch uses fruit ""juice concentrate"" which is just a nice way of saying they process fruit into a sugar syrup and remove almost everything that makes juice healthy in the process. Juice concentrate is barely any better than corn syrup.<br /><br />At the end of the day, this is a very tasty drink, but don't buy it if you're looking for a healthy beverage.",Neutral
"Like the other flavors of The Switch, Kiwi Berry is sweetened with a mixture of fruit juice concentrates which can lend to it's overly sweet taste. Although this flavor wasn't as sweet as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, for me it wasn't as good as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LG940E"">The Switch Black Cherry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.<br /><br />Although I can't see buying this drink for myself, my kids do like it.  I think The Switch might be best billed as a healthy alternative to soda for kids mainly because the flavors are much more geared towards that age group.",Neutral
"Is it a juice or is it a soda?  It's both!  Switch Kiwi Berry canned beverage has enough carbonation for it to be ""soda-like"" but it's not overpowering.  This particular flavor is made up of a variety of fruit juices, and I really didn't taste too much kiwi or strawberry.  To me, the apple juice flavor was the dominant one.  I like fruit juices and different beverage choices, and I really like the texture of this drink.  However, it is a bit too sweet for my liking and is pretty high in calories.  If the calorie count had been lower, my rating would be higher.  Children would probably really enjoy this drink, and it's definitely a healthier option than soft drinks or other sugary options.  I'd be interested to try some of the other flavors!",Neutral
"A nice juice drink, but it just didn't grab me like other flavors did. I would probably not purchase it in the future, though I did not dislike it. Like I said, it just didn't grab me.",Neutral
"The Switch Kiwi Berry drink is good tasting and all natural.  It should be emphasized that it is full-strength juice, not a ""flavored water"" type product.  For that reason, I found it a bit strong because I am not accustomed to drinking much juice.  The carbonation does add a bit of lightness to it though.  I like that it didn't taste too artificial.",Neutral
"You'll like it if you like sweet drinks.  Just a bit too sweet for me.  It has a strong flavor odor to it as well.  Doesn't really smell like strawberries or kiwi, but smells sweet.",Neutral
It is not a bad drink. It tastes great but nothing like Kiwi Berry flavor. I can taste more of the apple or punch flavor.<br />I like that it is all natural with no preservatives but I did not like the fact that it is very carbonated.<br />I also like the fact that it does not have corn syrup or sugar that is in most other carbonated beverages.,Neutral
"I was not overly impressed with this entry into the 'natural' soda sweepstakes. The flavor was OK, but it was achingly sweet. I enjoyed the small size, since it would be a better alternative to younger folks.<br /><br />But I would think twice because of the over-keening sweetnes.",Neutral
This product is extremely sweet to the taste. The berry flavor is overwhelming to the senses.<br /><br />Once you get used to the berry flavor (1/2 way through the can). It becomes more calm to the taste buds and is less striking.<br /><br />If you want a very sweet rare treat this will fit the bill. I could not drink this every day though.,Neutral
"I had previously imbibed a couple other flavors of Switch beverages, and I liked them a good bit.  This one was not bad, but certainly unremarkable.  The kiwi flavor was not very prominent, and I had to really try to distinguish that there was any kiwi flavor at all.  The berry is more what I tasted.  Since I'd like the other flavors so well, I was expecting I'd like this one as well, but I didn't even bother finishing the drink.  Other people might like it better, but I found it to be too sweet and not all that worthy of drinking.",Neutral
"I'm not a huge soft drink consumer, but I thought I would give this a try since it's being touted as a ""healthy soda alternative.""<br /><br />The Switch is a low-sugar carbonated drink that tastes fairly well, but is not as sweet as regular soft drinks or juices.  It felt a lot like a soft drink (that kind of weird filled-up feeling) but lacked pizazz when it came to taste - there wasn't a lot to the strawberry or the kiwi side and just made the drink feel a little flat.  I don't like super sweet foods, but I do like tons of flavor, so the drink didn't impress me too much.  This drink might be more of an acquired taste.<br /><br />I'd say sample this at your local grocery store or at a friend's house before buying.",Neutral
"If you are really thirsty this drink will be a welcomed choice, although almost anything would at that point.  However, I did not like this flavor as much as the Switch watermelon strawberry flavor which I found extremely refreshing.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry is also 100% juice. Although the drink is good, it has a strong syrupy berry flavor which reminded me a little bit of the Robitussin cough syrup I dislike. I also didn't taste any kiwi.<br /><br />At 135 calories for an 8.3 fluid ounce can you might want to drink it sparingly.",Neutral
"Switch is fruit juice that looks and drinks like a cola. From the packaging and branding to the carbonation, it looks to sub in for your favorite soda or energy drink and - let's face it - that's not a bad thing!<br /><br />The drink itself is pretty good. A fairly concentrated blend of fruit juices plays well on the palate by refreshing carbonation.  It doesn't feel thick or sticky like other beverages in 8 oz cans, but it does have a hint of that cough syrup flavor that is so common these days. Fortunately that bit isn't overwhelming and doesn't hang around long.<br /><br />After the swallow Switch is sweet, bubbly, and light - a perfect substitute for most sodas. At about a dollar a can, Switch is a great choice for anyone looking to cut back on cola or make their kids lunch a little healthier without making them look uncool. Even if it does still seem wrong to pay more for straight juice than heavily processed artificial flavors.",Neutral
"The flavor combination of kiwi, and strawberry is quite tasty.  With no sugar added, this gourmet soda keeps just the right amount of sweetness about itself.  Each can is only 8.5 Fl Oz (245 mL) - so in my mind it is rather pricey.",Neutral
"This is not a bad product, just an average one. It's carbonated fruit juice so it's certainly a better choice than soda, and contains 100% of your vitamin C for the day. But, the taste is nothing special -- strong on the strawberry flavor and sweeter than you would expect from juice.<br /><br />The price is rather steep once you figure in the per-ounce cost. I would rather have regular juice, skip the carbonation, and skip the high price. But, if you're trying to wean the kids off sugary soda, this is something worth considering -- they get the carbonation and sweetness of soda, but not the corn syrup and other junk.",Neutral
You will like this drink if you're into sweet tasting drinks. The bulk of the juice is apple and grape but it does have a strawberry taste with LIGHT carbonation and it is all-natural. It's an all-natural strawberry flavored Fanta!,Neutral
"Switch kiwi berry is very sweet, heavily flavored (almost overpoweringly so), and is lightly carbonated.  My husband said it was good, he'd drink it if it was free, but he wouldn't go out to buy it.  I'd say the same.  It was okay.<br /><br />I could taste a lot of grape flavoring that lingers along with a touch of apple.  I might even taste a tiny bit of kiwi, but I wouldn't describe the flavor as kiwi berry -- more like grape apple.<br /><br />Switch is too syrupy for me.  I'd prefer something more light and crisp.",Neutral
"pros:<br />1) 100% juice<br />2) no corn syrup<br />3) no extra sugar added<br />4) gluten free<br /><br />cons:<br />1) Cans are too small<br />2) Price way too high (probably because of the 100% juice)<br />(you could get 24 cans of arizona ice tea at the grocery store for roughly the same price, and arizona cans are like 3x as big)<br />3) too sweet tasting, not that refreshing .<br /><br />In conclusion, I probably wouldn't recommend it.",Neutral
"While the sugar count is slightly higher than a can of coca-cola, this soda gets it sugar from 100% Fruit Juice, not from High Fructose Corn Syrup.  I wouldn't give this to my daughter every day but as an alternative to soda once in awhile I think it is a good choice!  Plus it tastes great!",Neutral
"The benefit of this drink is that it is ""no sugar added, 100% juice,"" which tastes basically like fruit soda.  I can see it as a good alternative to traditional soda, especially for kids and teens.  However, for adults I think the drink still tastes really sugary, despite the fact that sugar has not been added.  I ran for my toothbrush as soon as I was finished.  However, the taste is good and the kiwi berry was a nice flavor.  For young people with a sweet tooth I would recommend it, but I think grown ups will have a more difficult time jumping on board.",Neutral
"I love the idea of carbonated juice - I really do. I love carbonation. I love juice. Put them together and you should have a sweeter version of what you can make with club soda and juice. So one star earned for the idea. One star for the convenience of me not having to mix my own club soda with juice and one star for convenience that it is in a can. As for taste - I didn't like it much at all. It was just too sweet. I like soda, but this was just over the top. This particular version my wife and I both agreed that it tasted really close to strawberry poprocks, which in and of itself is a good thing. I just didn't care for it as a carbonated fruit juice.  I'm going to give this a partial fail. It wasn't bad, but I wouldn't buy it again.",Neutral
"My husband and I tried the Orange Tangerine version of Switch, and also picked up this can of Kiwi Berry.  I thought we'd like the orange better, but we both ended up loving this Kiwi Berry.<br /><br />The taste is a perfect blend of tangy kiwi with smooth berry blended underneath.  This could be a heavy and sharp flavor without the sparkling water added, but together this is a very flavorful and refreshing drink.<br /><br />Our only disappointment was in the small size (8.3 oz) for the price.  This is very good tasting stuff, but I don't know how often we'll pay this much for a sip of goodness.",Neutral
"This stuff tastes awesome! And for once in a kiwi/berry drink you can taste the kiwi, I'd be very hard pressed to tell the difference between this and a traditional soda.<br /><br />I also like the fact that it's in a tall and slender can, fits in the fridge better and you can't mistake it for that pesky regular soda... :)<br /><br />However I would not say that this would be a better alternative to soda based on the fact that it still has a solid 33g of sugar. Yes it is better for you because it is made with 100% real juice instead of corn syrup, which I definitely like, but it's no different then drinking the 100% frozen juice from concentrate.<br /><br />Overall I really like the product and will probably buy some to have as an alternative to soda (for those few times a year).<br /><br />Pros:<br />You can actually taste the kiwi and the berries.<br />100% REAL juice, no artificial flavoring.<br />Very carbonated, not the least bit flat.<br />Quenches your thirst and is refreshing.<br />NO CORN SYRUP!!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Spendy.<br />Although it is all natural, still contains 33g of sugar...<br />135 calories a can (ouch!).",Neutral
"I found this soda simultaneously sweet and tart, which is interesting, with no bitter aftertaste or the acidic feeling of regular dark soda. It was a bit too sweet for me, and I couldn't taste the kiwi nor was I wowed over by the taste of fresh strawberries. In fact, it was not that much different than Hanson's (although I like their taste better). It's 100% juice and carbonated - I figured it would either taste like sparkling cider or something similar orange soda, but neither is correct. It seems a bit heavier than cider and not as bubbly as orange soda. It does not really have a fresh fruit taste to it, and it is a bit heavy on the taste (e.g. not a subtle, light taste).<br /><br />Being 100% juice this could be a better choice than soda for kids. But with 135 calories and 11% of your RDA of sugar in a small 8 oz can, you are only improving over the dyes and additives. If the sugars concern you, compare this to Soda Club's drinks and you will be much happier there. However, it does sport 100% of RDA of Vitamin C - so it might have a slight cold-fighting benefit as well. For an adult, I would pass. The soda is sized for kids and that also means more waste generated. It would be too easy to chug 4 of these, and while being fat free, it is not easy on the calories.<br /><br />Bottom line: I like it but don't love it; however it was too small, had too many calories, and is too pricey for everyday consumption.",Neutral
"This product is good. However, I feel the carbonation is a little more emphasised over the fruity flavor. Unless of course carbonation is really wanted. I didn't find the juice flavour as good as Juicy Juice. And the cost is ~50% more per ounce for Switch vs. Juicy Juice for my region.<br /><br />I would say that for everyone who is interested in this product... let your taste buds be your guide.",Neutral
"tastes good, but a little on the sweet side.  may not be for everyone.",Neutral
"My family and I recently tasted this Switch drink (as well as the Black Cherry flavor).  I found the kiwi strawberry taste to not be very distinguishable (ie, without reading the can I would have jard a hard time guessing what the flavor was).  My husband thought this was better than the cherry flavor, as did the kids (ages 11 & 9).<br /><br />We all found this drink to be very sweet, even without the added sugars.  I was not impressed with this drink and would not buy it again.",Neutral
"I don't like artificial sweeteners because they're too sweet, so while sipping Switch's Kiwi Berry drink, I kept rechecking the can for a sign of any sort of diet ingredient. None were listed.  Switch says there's nothing but sparkling juice in the can, no sugar or artificial sweeteners, so that's that.<br /><br />I like the amount of sparkle in the juice, but as a thirst quencher, it was too cloyingly sweet, at least for me. This certainly doesn't mean you might not love it -- I just prefer my sweet with a good dose of tart.<br /><br />Verdict: I'll stick to a good old-fashioned kiwi-strawberry beverage from Snapple or Trader Joe's or Costco. They all have good ones.<br /><br />By the way, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> was also sweet, but far more to my liking.",Neutral
"I decided to get this for my 7 yr old son to try to deter him from sugary drinks. Well this was pinkish and fizzy and looked nice, I took a sip and it kind of tasted like cough syrup lol...however HE LOVED IT. He wanted more...I did read the caloric content and ingredients and honestly it isnt any healthier than a soda! I will have to say that he did love it and I had ordered another flavor that he loved as well.",Neutral
"SWITCH isn't a bad product, but it's not great either.  I like the fact that it's all natural sparkling juice.  The can design is pleasant to look at.<br /><br />However, the Kiwi Berry flavor is a bit syrupy for my taste.  Also, at 135 calories per can, this beverage has almost 50% more calories per ounce than the average soda.  Too many for me.",Neutral
"I found the Switch Kiwi Berry Flavor to be good enough, but a little too sweet for my personal taste. I liked the fact that it was overly carbonated, and the amount in the can is just right, not too much to drink<br />at one time. It makes portion control easy. Would I buy it instead of a soda? Maybe not.",Neutral
"I tried the cherry and Strawberry Kiwi.  Both are similar in taste.  This beverage tastes okay, nothing special.  It is quite sweet and can I say ... a little salty (not sure where's that from!)  It's like mixing concentrate fruit juice with club soda or carbonated Libey's Juicy Juice?<br /><br />I would occasionally buy this product (because it doesn't taste bad at all) but I'll keep my fridge filled with Crush Orange soda for now...",Neutral
"I enjoy sodas and carbonated drinks, but don't drink too many of them because I'm trying to consume healthier things.  I was sent a can of The Switch through the Amazon's vine program to review.<br /><br />The smell is very strong, medicine-like, and somewhat unapproachable.  The taste on the other hand is very sweet, and it does have hints of the kiwi and strawberry flavors.  It's a little too sweet for my liking, but I am the type of person who drinks juice watered down.<br /><br />As far as being a ""healthy alternative to soda"", they do a pretty good job.  There's no HFCS (a big plus), and no artificial colors.  On the other hand, all of the juice in it is ""reconstituted from concentrates"".  The can says it has ""natural flavors"" which I always consider a dubious term to hide behind on items claiming to be ""healthy"".  Also, and 8.3 oz can of ""The Switch"" has 135 calories, while a 8.3 oz of Coke has roughly 109 calories, so this thing is a sugar bomb (even though it says there is ""no sugar added"".  No kidding!  It doesn't need it!).<br /><br />If you like really sweet things, then this might be a good buy for you.  As for myself, I don't think I'd go out of my way to try this again.",Neutral
"This is a tasty drink with pale pink/purplishcolor. With its carbonation one could call it a drink with bite. For me the taste was good but not outstanding. The aromatic bouquet of Switch is fabulous, but the actual taste, unfortunately, doesn't measure up to that mesmerizing scent.<br /><br />The can's diminutive size lends itself to a quick refresher, not a slake for a heavy duty thirst. It's a good size for a pocket, lunch bag, or purse.",Neutral
"Pros:<br />Tastes pretty good<br />Slightly lower sugar than soda<br />Vitamin C<br />Carbonation adds a little pizzazz<br /><br />Cons:<br />Leans toward being too sweet (at least for me)<br />Not significantly healthier<br />3/4 size can compared to regular 12 oz drink<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />It's an okay but not great blending of the soda and juice worlds. Personally I would say stick with the real thing for more satisfaction. IE, if you're in the mood for a juice beverage, grab juice. Soda same thing.",Neutral
"This tastes very similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH54"">The Switch Watermelon Strawberry, 8.3 Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and seems to be identical except for a touch of Kiwi and Strawberry juice.  Its got 135 calories so is not a diet drink.  It's really sweet and would go well as a drink mixer like the watermelon strawberry variety.<br /><br />It's got light carbonation, 100% of the USRDA of vitamin C and costs about $1.00 a can.  Personally, I'll stick to plain old tap water because this is really just extra calories and not worth $1.00 a can.  It is a nice fruity sweet drink that many might like to go along with lunch.",Neutral
"The ingredients on this item show several natural fruit juices, but the first one on the list is apple, followed by grape.  Kiwi & Berry juices are further down the list.  I know this is actually fairly common in beverages that have multiple tastes...apple and grape become the ""base"" and other juices are added in moderation to create a convincing flavor in which the taste of the apple and/or grape fades to the background.<br /><br />Not so in this case of the Kiwi Berry Switch.  It tasted, to me, like apple juice with sparkling water added.  This in not a BAD thing...I kind of like that taste (having spent many years in Germany, the ""Apfelschorle"" (sparkling apple juice) is a commonly served drink which I always enjoyed.  HOWEVER, I was expecting something that tasted like Kiwi Berry...and in this I was disappointed.<br /><br />It's nice that SWITCH makes these sodes without any corn syrup or other additives...just juice and carbonated water.  They're still high in calories and sugar content though...so it's not exactly a health drink.  And I wouldn't say it's worth paying more than I would for another ""regular"" soda.<br /><br />It's a refreshing drink, but I can only give it the most lukewarm recommendation because it doesn't taste like what the can promises, and offers only modest ""health"" reasons, none of which really justify a higher price.",Neutral
"Each of these Switch juice drinks seems to be about 50 percent sweeter than it needs to be. Imagine mixing Perrier, Kool-Aid and Mountain Dew together and you've got a good idea what to expect. OK, I know it's not that bad. But would somebody please tell my taste buds?",Neutral
The Switch Kiwi Berry is a nice refreshing alternative to the typical carbonated soft-drinks on the market.<br /><br />The taste although unusual at first is rather pleasant once you get used to it. I'd describe it as a cross between those Dole Blended juices and soda water. Strange as it sounds it actually tastes good.<br /><br />Although I suppose it's slightly better for you than soda - The Switch doesn't use High-Fructose Corn Syrup - it's still full of calories and carbs.<br /><br />Still for people who generally don't drink soda such as myself but find themselves occasionally craving a carbonated beverage this is a nice alternative.<br /><br />The can is only 8.3 oz. which does make it considerably smaller than a can of soda. As long as you can stick to only drinking one you'll be slightly better off than drinking a typical non-diet soda.,Neutral
"It tastes light and fizzy.  I liked the taste but would not 'switch' and buy this instead of my favorite juices/pop.  If someone handed it to me, I wouldn't refuse it.",Neutral
"This drink is refreshing, but a little too sweet for me. I found that others in my household enjoyed it more than I did, so it might be more fair to give it a four star.",Neutral
"This flavor has a much more mild flavor than the Black Cherry flavor I reviewed earlier.  While the juices in this can are apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry, and strawberry in order of their respective strengths, the strawberry flavor stands out the most.  I enjoyed this flavor more because the sweetness was not overpowering and the carbonation remained light so I didn't feel like I wanted to drink a glass of water immediately after.  It's a little expensive for an 8.3oz can but I'd purchase this again.",Neutral
"Think kiddie juice box with a kick - plus surprisingly flavorful. That basically describes this interesting drink. The cans are 8.3ozs, slim and perfect for toting along. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives. This is definitely a good alternative for kids' lunch boxes.<br />Flavor-wise, you definitely can taste the kiwi fruit and strawberry. Considering that most ""fruit"" drinks taste like syrup water, it was nice to have something actually NATURALLY flavored and carbonated so my kids' think they are getting ""soda""when in reality they are getting something infinitely better.",Neutral
"Pleasant mixture of fruit tastes and the level of carbonation is refreshing.<br /><br />However, I found--particularly in the initial tastes-- the drink to be too sweet. You may well enjoy it, though, since I prefer carbonated fruit drinks more on the citrus/sour end.<br /><br />The over-sweetness isn't accomplished with added sugar, or non-sugar additives; the sweetness comes from the apple and grape juice concentrates, which are the top two non-water ingredients.",Neutral
"The kiwi/berry soda drink was tasty.  I enjoyed the light fruity flavor instead of the intensity and heaviness of the popular canned cola drinks.  The effervescence was perfect....again, not so intense as the other sodas.  The cans are small(only 8.3 oz.), but adequate for a small thirst.  The idea of healthy 100% fruit juices combined with a slight carbonation is fine for children and adults alike.  Probably the only downside is the price per can compared to those very popular, but ultra-sugary or fake sugar colas and other canned soft drinks....but, you getting a far better product.",Neutral
"I've tried a few different flavors of Switch and this is my least favorite. (My favorite is the cherry.) Unfortunately because I didn't enjoy this flavor I didn't find it as refreshing as the others.<br /><br />I quickly handed it over to my son who does like kiwi berry flavors and he did like it a lot. Of course, since it contains enough vitamin C for a whole day, I felt just fine giving it to my child, too. No preservatives, no added sugar. I like the carbonated soda product a lot, just not this flavor.<br /><br />However, the biggest flaw with this product is that it's too expensive in my opinion for the little cans you get. Rounds out to about $1 per can. Less than you pay often with a vending machine but twice what you pay for a flavored water or vitamin C juice pouch when you buy them in larger quantity. Not worth it. :(",Neutral
"The Switch Kiwi Berry is very sweet, but tastes much better than the Orange Tangerine or the Black Cherry.

"Don't get me wrong, it is good. It is sweet and tart. It is slightly fizzy but not overly so. It is just big enough to quench your thirst before it gets warm.<br /><br />But WOW, it was sweet. I mean, this is Kool-aid meets Grenadine syrup with some lemon-lime soda tossed in. So if you are looking for something like soda water with a slight flavor, just keep going. If you want a sweet drink to get rid of a craving, then this is for you!",Neutral
"It is a good concept to carbonate juice.  The kids loved it and called it ""soda"".  It has a nice flavor but it is difficult to taste the individual fruit juices though.",Neutral
"This soda is all natural unlike many others that have artificial flavoring and sweeteners.  That, in itself, makes it ok in my book. The key takeaways from tasting this is that 1. It actually taste like a soda pop and not just juice with carbonation in it.  2. It's as sweet as artificial sodas without the artificial sweeteners. Since it's all natural I guess that's alright.  3. The Kiwi can be a bit overpowering.  So only get this if you really like Kiwis.",Neutral
"As a kid I grew up picking and eating my own oranges, mangoes, bananas, watermelon other tropical fruits.  I know what 100% natural fruit juice tastes like and Switch kiwi berry does not taste like it is a product of 100% natural fruit juice.  This product like its watermelon strawberry cousin does not taste natural.  If kiwi flavor had been absent I don't think I could differentiate this product from a berry soda you can get from any vending machine.  Moreover I am not crazy about carbonated drinks considering the current discussion about certain negative side effects that may be caused by carbonation in general.  You really can't put fresh fruit in a canned drink.  For those of you who are interested in a nutritious fruit drink that is good for you, take some frozen grapes, strawberries or cherries and put them in a smoothie blender.  Add some grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice or whatever you have (that is 100% fruit product), some kiwi and pineapple (if you like), a banana (if you want some thickness) and some ice.  Blend and then pour in a nice ice cold glass and enjoy!  Now this is 100% naturally good for you.  Nice try Switch - but I'd rather switch.",Neutral
"I am not one with a 'sweet tooth' per se.  I didn't care for it but maybe someone who is hungering for something sweet would. It was just too sweet for me. I thought maybe my 10yr old would try it and he did not either!<br />34g of carbs and 135 calories in this 8oz can, I think I will stick with good old H2O.",Neutral
"This is a sweet, mild flavored and lightly carbonated juice mix which is dominated by the flavor of apple juice and white grape juice. These probably  make up at least 80 to 90% of this juice by volume. The juice is a pleasant mild red or pink blush color. The mild kiwi and berry flavor appears almost as a pleasant aftertaste rather than the dominant flavor note.<br /><br />If you enjoy a juice which is sweet without much tartness and with a low level of carbonation this has a pleasant but not outstanding flavor. I personally prefer stronger flavors and more carbonation.  Sparking juices are expensive and this one is no exception so overall I have no intent to get it again.<br /><br />While the marketing suggestion (""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"") is that the natural ingredients make these juices healthy that idea is negated by the high level of completely ""natural"" sugar in this or most any juice. The healthy alterative to overly sugared fruit juices is to have a glass of cold water and a piece of fresh fruit. Fruit has less calories than juice but overall more vitamins, minerals and fiber and a variety of natural antioxidants that most likely really are good for you.",Neutral
Title says it all. There really is nothing special about this drink. It's virtually indisguishable from many other carbonated drinks out there. This drink is so average that I hardly even see a reason to write a review about it. I certainly couldn't see going to the trouble to order it over the Internet.,Neutral
"The Switch Kiwi Berry is 8.3 ounces and has 135 calories, 15 mg of Sodium, 34 g of carbs (11% of daily value), 33 g of sugar and oh yeah 100% of your Vitamin C daily value. Mind you, a 12 oz can of Coke has 140 calories, 50mg of Sodium, 39g of carbs and 39g of sugar. So apart from the no sugar added, preservatives and all the added artifial stuff, there is not much of a difference in nutrition between these two products. Need the Vitamin C? Drink orange juice. Yes, the Switch may be a tad healthier but it is still a can of empty calories. Moreover, a can of this may not be enough for most people, so double the calories if you decide to drink two.<br /><br />As for taste, it is too sweet. I agree with the reviewer that said that this tasted like apple juice. It does. It tastes like over sweetened apple juice. There is a slight (very slight) hink of kiwi and none of berries. The sweetness is too strong at first but it does grow on you.<br /><br />This soda has way too much sugar, almost as much as a regular can of soda, and it tastes like it. It is too sweet for my taste. Frankly, giving the calories for this small can, it is not worth it. Now, I would like to try the Diet version if there was one.<br /><br />As for price, each can is about a dollar. Way too expensive. This is like paying $1 for each of those small Coke cans (the 8 oz small cans). Would you pay a dollar for one of those? Neither would I.",Neutral
"The kiwi/berry combination makes this sweet and tart at the same time, with the carbonation adding a nice bit of fizz to keep the concoction light. That being said, this was a bit too sweet for my taste - but may be fine for people looking for the 100% juice experience, or those needing a sugar fix after a workout. Personally I'd mix this with sparkling soda water for a ""less is more"" effect, with cost savings as an added plus.",Neutral
"The Switch is apparently supposed to be a substitute for soda, with fizz but without corn syrup or added sugar, just juice.  However, the product, billed as ""Kiwi Berry"", has 135 calories in 8 ounces--more than one would get in soda--and is in fact mostly highly caloric apple and grape juice, for the sweetness, with kiwi and berries later in the ingredient list.  Yes, it is tasty, but a more healthy alternative would be club soda (or water, if you can do without the carbonation) with some juice added.",Neutral
"Last summer, our family discovered <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CC734G"">Izze Sparkling Juice Variety Pack - 12/12 Oz Btls</a> and used them for special treats on really hot days. They were refreshing and because they did not add any sugar we could fool ourselves into thinking they were healthy (they are healthier...)<br /><br />When we saw Switch, we thought we might be getting even more of the same in new flavors.  Unfortunately, these are more syrupy than the Izzy's.  At least for adults, the are less crisp and refreshing.  However, kids would of course prefer these as they are sweeter.<br /><br />We also tried Watermelon/Strawberry and we liked the Kiwi Berry better.  The watermelon/Strawberry had a much more Jolly Rancher like taste. I think we are going to stick to our Izzy's I think.",Neutral
"I am definitely a mom who wants to limit the amount of ""junk"" food in our home, including sodas, so I was intrigued by a new natural fruit drink with carbonation. We have had other natural carbonated beverages and enjoyed them, but the family would still choose plain old juice or Sunkist soda over any of these when given the choice.<br /><br />The Kiwi Berry Switch has had the same reception. The family finds it to be okay, but nothing that will make them trade in their favorites. It is a fruit drink with light carbonation, more natural than most traditional soda, but still just as sugary, even if the sweetness is primarily from natural fruit sugars. Therefore, I find little reason to encourage them to Switch.<br /><br />Its taste reminded me of the old Strawberry Crush from when I was a kid, but not quite a potent. It is pleasant enough, but as my son put it ""I would drink it if it were all that we had in the fridge but I would not ask you to buy it again"". Also, I am not necessarily sure it is  worth the cost of nearly $1 per can (a small can compared to traditional soda).<br /><br />Bottom line: We have tried other natural sodas that we found better tasting and less expensive. It's not bad, so it might be worth a try to see which of the natural brands your family likes best. Don't expect it to replace soft drinks for those in the family that really enjoy them, and don't expect it to be a great, healthy alternative since it is still high in carbs/sugar.",Neutral
"I've read a few reviews for this product complaining that it's too sweet to drink truthfully. I'm a soda drinker but I usually stay away from fruit sodas as they do tend to be sweeter to taste than say a cola or root beer. To me though The Switch billed as a healthier alternative to soda had a less sugary taste compared to something like Fanta or the like that was perfectly fine I suppose if it truthfully was healthier than soda. Personally I never really go for the idea of alternatives and with the price of the product, the ammount given I wouldn't really recommend it over regular water or just drinking some type of juice. Then again if you really must having something billed as a healthy alternative to soda then its not bad I suppose just not something I'd be interested in personally.",Neutral
"When it comes to low-calorie drinks, I'll usually partake in a flavored water or apple juice. This little can, however, packed some big taste!<br /><br />First Impressions: I must admit, I was disappointed in the size of the container. Sure, it's slender and can fit on shelves easier, but in the end, it means less juice. I read about the promise of 100% juice and 0% added sugars and preservatives. I knew the only way to properly test this out was to crack open the can.<br /><br />Appearance and Nutrition:  This can is identical to the size of a Red Bull, giving us about 8.3 ounces to drink, roughly 4 less than a standard soda can.<br />The nutritional facts tell us that each one of these little cans packs 135 calories. There's sodium and a pretty high carbohydrate count of 34 grams - plus 33 grams of sugar (that's regular, not added). It does have 100% vitamin C, so there's a plus.<br /><br />Taste: This is a sweet, fruity drink. The sweetness is natural, not artificial, which is a very nice change of pace for those who want to kick soda to the curb. It has the right blend of kiwi, raspberry, strawberry, apple and grape juices - no one overpowers the other. If a drink has a high carbonation level I usually hiccup, but that didn't happen here.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: While the taste is good, I'm not ready to ""make the switch"" for two main reasons:<br />(1) The small can size.<br />(2) The large calorie count.<br /><br />For a quick burst of fruity goodness, this is a good choice. However, if you want more drink with fewer calories, I'd suggest a 1-liter bottle of Clear Splash water, which retails for about the same price.",Neutral
"The flavor is pretty good.  It's sweet, tart, and tangy.  The calories are okay, 135 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  You wouldn't want to drink a lot of it every day, but 135 calories is fine for once or twice a day.  The fizz is light, similar to Fanta, which is something I really like about this product.  The only thing I don't like is the taste that the vitamin c adds.  The extra vitamin c gives it an aftertaste similar to red bull and other energy drinks.  I think this product would taste a lot better without it, and I don't see any real value in having it.  Vitamin C is one of the easiest vitamins to get.  There aren't a lot of people in the modern world running around with scurvy.<br /><br />The other concern is price.  This stuff is very expensive, almost $1 per 8.3 oz can.  The idea here is suppose to be that this is a soda replacement.  At that price, I don't think so.  A 12 pack of soda (with 12 oz cans) typially runs from $3 - $5.  The Switch costs more than double that.  If this product wants to compete with the soda market they really need to bring the price down.<br /><br />If you like this, just get some low sodium Pellegrino and some concentrated juices.  You can mix your own for a lot less and not have the vitamin c aftertaste.",Neutral
"At around a buck a can, very expensive for 8.3 ounces of carbonated apple juice (with lesser amounts of grape juice, aceola whatever that is, raspberry juice, and finally actual strawberry and kiwi juice, plus some vitamin C added).<br /><br />With the 100% juice banner all over that can, you might be led to believe it's 100% strawberry/kiwi juice . . . it's not.

"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40"">The Switch Kiwi Berry</a> does taste great but the problem is that it tastes nothing like Kiwi Or berry.<br /><br />This flavor has more of a punch flavor is you ask me.

"While the flavor sounded good, kiwi berry, this is mostly an apple and grape juice based product. It is all natural, but it almost had an herb flavor, like I think of ginseng or something, though it was not included in the ingredients. The carbonation was about right and the flavor is sweet. I couldn't really distinguish the kiwi very strongly, and I wish I had been able to. It's not a bad drink and it is definitely better than many other options out there, but it's not one I'd seek out specifically, probably only buying if it were on sale.",Neutral
"***<br />The Switch claims to be an alternative to unhealthy sodas, and it is that--it is much healthy than most of the commercial versions out there. It does provide 100% of the day's vitamin C and does contain only fruit juice concentrates, no added sugars, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and no gluten.<br /><br />However...it is cloyingly sweet--a great taste of kiwi and strawberries--but way too sweet for me. The Switch also provides a huge sugar hit via the fructose in the highly concentrated juices and has 135 calories in only 8.3 fluid ounces. Of 34 grams of carbohydrates, 33 are from sugar.<br /><br />I don't carbo load, so it doesn't really appeal to me at all. I'd rather eat the real fruit and get the fiber and other ingredients, or else have a less sweet drink. I tried using it as a concentrate and mixing 1 part soda to 3 parts water, which made it drinkable for me; although this worked well, I'd still probably stick with other beverages.<br /><br />Recommended, only if you want to ease your way off of unhealthy sodas and like very sweet drinks.<br />***",Neutral
"""The Switch"" reminds me a lot of carbonated apple cider. It has a carbonated sweet taste (with no sugar added, no preservatives according to the label). The label states that it has 100% Juice. To me it tastes light, on the diluted side, and very similar in taste to the apple cider bottle you serve kids for thanksgiving instead of real champagne. There is a slightly detectable taste of strawberry and maybe kiwi.<br /><br />Pros:<br />100% Vitamin C<br />Low Sodium of 15mg<br />Tastes good if you like the light carbonated Perrier-Like Taste.<br />Fat: 0mg<br /><br />Cons:<br />33g of sugar (although it says no sugar added)<br />34g of carbs - too much carbs if you're trying to cut down on carbs<br /><br />Conclusion: Keep in mind that this review reflects my personal opinion of the product beside the facts listed on the can. I personally prefer less carbonated fruit drinks with a stronger taste rather than the very light taste of this product. it is 135 calories for 8.3 fl oz. You also feel you need a glass of water to wash out the after taste. Overall, it tastes good and I can recommend it to anyone who's not trying to cut down on the amount of daily carbs or sugar intakes.",Neutral
"Switched Kiwi Berry is fairly good soft drink; strongly berry-flavored with a light hint of kiwi. Nutritionally, the drink contains more sugar and calories than an equivalent 8 oz serving of soda or iced tea, but these seem in-line with other juice beverages. This drink makes me curious why Snapple didn't branch into carbonated fruit beverages, but perhaps the reason may have something to do with cost. It is difficult to select this beverage when it costs two to three times more than soda or canned iced tea; however, I would buy a case of mixed flavors, if such an SKU became available, for entertaining purposes.",Neutral
"The Switch Juice is pretty good!  It is 100% Juice, and LOADED with complex carbohydrates!  It has to be loaded, considering the 135 calories (at a little over 8 oz), and the 33g (!!!) of sugar.  I did like the sweet/tart taste which reminded me of the candy with the same name.  I also liked the fact that it's carbonated, but not too noticeable because of the sweet/tart taste.<br /><br />The pros of the Switch Juice are:<br />No Sugar Added<br />No Corn Syrup<br />No Preservatives<br />No Artificial Colors<br />100% Pure Juice<br />All Natural<br /><br />The cons:<br />The price per can (considering 8.3oz size)<br />The calorie load<br />The sugar content<br /><br />So, if you like juice and are looking for something to drink after a long workout, this one is a good choice.  You get energy and great taste in a somewhat small can.  Gatorade is much cheaper and a better choice for quenching thirst.",Neutral
"I like the idea behind this product, but the taste was just too sweet for me, and it has a strange aftertaste. While it has no added sugar or corn syrup, there are plenty of calories (135 for an 8.3 ounce can) and carbs. Also, looking at the price, I think it is way too expensive-almost a dollar a can. I would chose flavored seltzer over this any day.",Neutral
"Sparkling juices aren't anything new and the Switch simply gives us more of the same. Whether you are drinking Welche's Sparking juice or an Izze, it comes down to flavor, nutrients and cost.<br /><br />Izze flavors are Apple, Pomegranate, Black Cherry, Grapefruit and Clementine.<br />Switch offers Orange, Watermelon, Kiwi-Berry (the flavor I tried), Black Cherry and Fruit punch.<br /><br />Also Izze gives you 10% of your daily allowance of Vitamin C, B6 and Niacin.<br />Switch gives you 100% of your daily vitamin C.<br /><br />Izze currently is $21.62 for 24 cans at 8.4 oz.<br />Switch is currently advertised at about a buck more for 24 cans at only 8.3oz cans.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />With Switch, you pay a similar cost to get more vitamin C and different flavors than offered by the main competitor.<br /><br />Could a vitamin supplement give you more of what you really need? Sure. But it's not nearly as fun as drinking any of these sparking juices.<br /><br />So if you need a more healthy alternative to soda, determine if cost, nutrients and/or flavor is your thing then try a Switch or an Izze.",Neutral
"I tried one 8.3 oz of Switch in Kiwi Berry flavor. The can is very small, about the size of a Red Bull.

On Amazon, the price comes out to about $1 per can.<br /><br />I like the fact that Switch is all natural, but the sugar content is still quite high (I believe a 12oz can of coke has 40g of sugar). Calories are not to be ignored either. The taste was OK, but not fantastic by any means - very sugary, not enough carbonation. In fact, the Kiwi Berry flavor did remind me of Red Bull as well, which I do not particularly enjoy. I think I'll stick to unsweetened iced tea...",Neutral

I couldn't identify any kiwi flavor at all, and the berry flavor did not taste like any berry I have ever eaten.  In fact, strawberry is the very last of the juice concentrates listed.  They mixed apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juices together.  I think having just one juice flavor would have been better because this mix was just bizarre.  Also, the drink contains 135 calories per 8.3 ounce serving.  At that rate, I'd rather have a Coke if I want carbonation or regular juice if I want something fruit flavored.",Neutral
"This drink wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It's supposed to be Kiwi floavord but the  it doesn't quite make what it's going for.

"I'll admit I'm a coffee snob. I drink only organic, and I grind my own beans w/ a burr grinder.  I only bought this coffee ground because my husband isn't quite as picky as I am and doesn't want to be bothered grinding the beans every time he wants a cup (We drink a lot of coffee---going through about 2 lbs. a week).  I love my coffee REALLY strong, but there's a difference between rich, strong coffee and bitter coffee, and this coffee unfortunately falls into the latter category.  I took a chance w/ this one, and although the first time I had it, it seemed ""okay,"" the second time, it was just bitter and with a weird aftertaste.<br /><br />I'm finding it more and more difficult to get a decent coffee at a decent price. Lately, every coffee I get is either stale tasting or bitter.  I would love to find a decent, whole-bean organic coffee that is freshly roasted and that doesn't cost more than $10 a lb.

"These are tasty enough.  Indeed, if you mix in a tablespoon of raspberry jam or a half-teaspoon of cinnamon, these are QUITE tasty.  But they have no cohesion.  We try to cut them, and they crumble in the pan.  I know gluten-free baked goods tend to be more crumbly than the conventional stuff, but we made Betty Crocker, and they held together just fine.  As tasty as these are, I can't arrange them on a platter and serve them to my friends.  So I'll stick with Betty for a while, but thanks anyway.",Neutral

Was happy about the fast shipping but was not happy that I recieved a blue mat when I wanted the silver one pictured. Also it was mailed rolled even though the package it was sent in was large enough to lay it flat. Now it has a kink in it. Overall, I like this product because it does elminate some of the mess the cats track out of the litter box.

This usually refers to the amount of coffee, but when I brewed it on the ""tall"" setting so that it is not so strong, it still was way too intense for my taste.

"I'm giving this three stars because it's so low in calories and doesn't cause gastrointestinal effects. It worked fine when I made my own mint chocolate with unsweetened chocolate and mint extract. That tasted good. But, it was terrible when I made chocolate biscotti (Xylitol works fine). I had to throw the big batch away. It has a strong ""cotton candy"" aftertaste.<br /><br />The gastrointestinal effects of Xylitol can be mostly overcome by gradually increasing the amount you eat over time. It tastes much better than Erythritol. But, as I mentioned, you can make a very interesting bitter mint chocolate with it. The erythritol doesn't dissolve so at first the taste is very bitter not sweet chocolate. Then, as the erythritol dissolves in your mouth, you get a burst of sweetness and cooling effect. The cooling effect of the erythritol is so powerful that is enhances the mint. The chocolate overcomes the ""cotton candy"" aftertaste if you don't use too much erythritol.",Neutral
"Not a very cost effective sweetener, takes too much to do the job.  I believe that truvia (a combination of erythritol and stevia extract) is much more likable and costs less to use.  We didn't mind the taste as some others did, but were glad we only bought one pound.",Neutral
"This is advertised as a powder...which it is not. When you get the package and you read the smaller print it says crystalline powder. AKA, it's small crystals.

If you really like the spice combination (I like cinnamon, for example, in almost everything, but in the chocolate mix it just doesn't make it for me), you'll love it.  I guess my advice is the product is fine if you like the flavor combination, but I would advise trying the mix in a small packet to determine whether or not it's for you.  I have this huge quantity to consume, and I rarely partake of it as I don't really care much for it.",Neutral

You can vary the consistency depending on  how much water you use.  For smoothie, you can just add the powder right into your blender.  The taste to me is rather bland.  Sure-obviously it is missing the FAT- but it is lacking in something else as well...just can't put my finger on it...",Neutral

I don't like that sugar has been added since I only use natural PB that needs to be stirred w/ no extra oils etc. I like PB but am not a 'nut' about it. Perhaps this will taste better mixed with other items so I'll try but since I don't eat lots to begin with, it's not a product I'll repurchase.",Neutral
"At first it is not so hot but.... it grows on you.  I added a very tiny amount of honey in warm water to mix, dash of salt too.  like it so much I made up the entire jar like that and kept it ready in refrig .  I put it on apple slices as a pm snack or mid morning break.  Spreads nicely on an apple, unlike real PB.  Love not getting all those calories.",Neutral
"I found the taste to be satisfactory, especially for the reduction in calories.  I didn't mix it right the first time I had to end up making double, which I ate of course.  Ultimately, I decided that I really like crunchy peanut butter the best.  However, my belly will welcome the PB2 just fine.",Neutral
"It's a relatively smaller jar that you get..about comparable to the smaller jars of PB you buy at a grocery store.  I love peanut butter but had cut it out of my diet because of the fat.  This was good when mixed with jelly, jam or honey..you can eat it just like that or spread it on bread/toast.  Yucky when mixed with water to dip fruit...wasn't salty enough and had a funny texture/taste.  Haven't tried it in cooking yet.<br /><br />ON BACK OF JAR ~ 2 Tb serving:  1.5g fat, 94 mg sodium, 5g carb, 2g fiber, 5g protein.  Ingred: roasted peanuts (defatted and powdrd), sugar and salt.<br /><br />Apparently there are other local places where you can get it much more cheaply and without the shipping.  Way too expensive for one jar and the exhorbitant shipping charges.",Neutral
"This review is primarily for the PB2 product (not the chocolate). As an avid PB fan, I wanted to try these, for the obvious caloric advantage over any other PB on the market. The PB2 has a definite ""natural"" PB-product flavor, and can be mixed to lend a similar consistency to peanut butter. That being said, I found it is not as fulfilling when snacked on alone, with a spoon. That being said, I imagine it would make an amazing replacement for real PB in any cooking recipe or blending protein shake. I did enjoy the chocolate flavored PB2 on its own, and would definitely buy it to snack on by itself again. :)",Neutral
"This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes.",Neutral
"Consider buying this from Bell Plantations it's much cheaper, about $3.99 a jar.  Amazon is riping people off with this product, shame on them!",Neutral

"PB is a major source of calories, so this is a pretty great idea. However, it's honestly just too expensive to purchase as a regular replacement for peanut butter. The taste is just OK: when mixed with water, it tastes vaguely like peanut butter, but it's tough to get a very similar texture. Mixed in protein shakes, though, it's absolutely great. I would buy it exclusively for that purpose if the price were a bit more reasonable.",Neutral
It's a good tasting peanut butter when mixed by a 1:1 ratio with water (sometimes added a bit of Truvia to make it sweeter) but didn't provide nearly as many servings as it says it will. i probably only got 9 out of it.,Neutral

"I was anxious to try this lower calorie version of one of my favorite foods. Overall, texture is fine, but taste is bland and seems to lack depth of real peanut butter. I would use this in recipes, but was sad to say it wasn't my favorite and I would eat regular peanut butter instead.",Neutral
"I really like the taste of this powder.  It is great in a protein shake, especially with 1/2 banana blended in.  My issue is with the shelf life of the product.  A 6.5 oz container lasts a long time, but the container that I purchased from Amazon expired in less than a month from the purchase date.  I noticed that the date of production was exactly a year ago.  Most protein powders have a shelf life of a couple of years.",Neutral
"I Loooove peanut better and this ersatz butter tastes pretty good to me and has 0 cholesterol. Nevertheless, because of its high calorie count and high price, I can stretch the rating to only 3 stars. Yes, the taste is good but, in order to get a 2 tablespoon serving, you need at least 6 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 3 tablespoons of water. Otherwise, 2 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 1 of water will yield only about 1.5 teaspoons of spreadable ""peanut butter""-- Barely enough to coat half a slice of bread. And so...one serving (2 tablespoonsful) of the mixture ends up being 135 calories--not 45 calories which is the count for 2 tablespoons of the powder. If you're counting calories and pennies, you might as well get the regular peanut butter for less than half the price of the dry stuff.",Neutral
"Let's be honest. Nothing will compare to real peanut butter - more specifically, Smuckers All Natural (creamy or crunchy, they both go down smooth). I'll crush a 26oz jar in a week, so obviously I needed a better alternative. Definitely still has a peanuty taste, but... something is missing. I'd still recommend this to anyone who is curious about it. I need to try some of the recipes they have on their website.",Neutral
"I like this product because it is low in calories and it  produces a smooth PB of good quality, if you follow the instructions.<br /><br />However, it is not as tasty as any other peanut butter, especially the commercial ones such as Jiff, Skippy, etc. And it does not satiate you in the same way, since it doesn't have the fat.<br /><br />I happen to like natural PB and this one tends to resemble their taste. I will conyinue to buy it for what it is and despite the price.",Neutral
"This product really deserves 4 or 5 stars for the product itself.  However, as others have noted, Amazon has WAY overpriced it.  The manufacturer has its own website where it is much, much cheaper.",Neutral
"The product gets 5 stars.... Great taste, less fat, easy to throw into smoothies, turn into peanut dressing, for thai food or satay like dishes.<br /><br />Amazon pricing gets 1 star.

"I really wanted to like this product. I really, really did. Having to cut back on fats and sugars, this seemed an ideal product for me. However, I just can't cope with the flavor. Mixing the powder with sugar free jelly produced a water mess that seeped out the sides of my sandwich. Plus, the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the little bit of jelly I threw in, despite using two heaping tablespoons of powder. Using it on its own, mixed with water, produced a consistency that was more what I'm use to encountering with peanut butter, but again the taste was lacking. It tasted like an echo of a slightly burned roasted peanut. I'm sure the product is a great one for what it is, but I just can't see using it as a substitute for non-powdered peanut butter.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the texture,when mixed with water, has a nice consistency, and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix. I also think that it would be great for baking...maybe for rolling truffles in to give it a powdery hint-of-peanut coating.",Neutral
"PB2 turned out to be a pretty good alternative to peanut butter. Although its definitely not as sweet it still tastes good on PB and jelly sandwiches and overall I thought it was pretty good. Its no Jiff, but if you are trying to cut back on calories it's a great substitute.",Neutral
"I love peanut butter, and I bought this product in an effort to save some fat, while keeping the protein.  Truthfully, I don't think it's that great on its own... I mixed a little with water to make a peanut-butter-like paste, like it said, and ate it on whole-grain toast.  The flavor just isn't the same as regular peanut butter, and the texture was a little gritty.  For this, I'd rather just use a tablespoon of regular peanut butter - with such a small amount, it isn't much fat anyways.<br /><br />However, the PB2 powder is MUCH better in a protein shake or smoothie because it mixes with the other ingredients and provides that hint of peanut butter flavor.  I think it also might be alright if you made it in to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Either way, it is a great substitute for peanut butter, if you can get past the fact that it doesn't taste exactly the same.  I'm going to try and get used to it!",Neutral
"I was disappointed to discover that once mixed, the tablespoon value of end product required 3 times the quantity to make a sandwich, meaning those label values are multiplied times 3.  I might as well just eat regular peanut butter when I figured up the caloric difference and carbs and sugar.  The taste was good on toast, so I've gone back and given product an extra star for that.",Neutral

"I normally like Assam teas, but this is pretty bland -- the flavor is simple & shallow.  There's no richness, earthiness or depth.  Considering that this a pound bag of the stuff, if you buy it there'll be a lot of boring tea to slog through (or throw out).<br /><br />One reviewer commented about the paper package impairing retention of flavor.  FWIW, while the outer bag is paper, it's plastic-coated on the inside; it may not be a hermetic seal, but it's adequate.  Based on my experience, if you're spooning single servings, you can probably expect the wire fold-closure to break halfway through the bag, so have a clothespin around.",Neutral
"This is a good tea, for an incredible price.  However, unless you drink tea on a daily basis, it is probably not what you're looking for.

As for these Barksters, they are made with only four ingredients and all are healthy ingredients. All of my picky Chihuahua's love the treats, or I should say they loved the crumbs.

Perhaps this salt would go well with sea food, but since I don't eat a lot of sea food it is not for me.  Another disappointment for me is the loss of crunchiness when this salt touches anything moist;  other salts seem to be able to hold onto their crunch a little better.

"I heard Maldon was supposed to have a wonderful taste. After using it for a while, my husband and I don't care for the tast so much. As far as the use of it, I was under the impression it was to be used in cooking, but heard later it was for garnishing on a finished plate. When added to a pan to saute, it takes alot longer to melt than kosher salt. Some of the thicker flakes never melt completely, so we get a mouthful of large salt flakes with some bites of our meal (which I don't like). Used as a garnish, it looks cool but again, it's way to salty and thick for me to eat. The flavor is a very clean, super salty taste- more salty than the other sea and kosher salts we use. I know it is very popular so I am probably one of the few that doesn't care for it.",Neutral

It works great to make a beeswax, coconut, hemp oil blend that I can use for a lip balm (just melt together in the microwave and wala!),  I can't taste it when I use it this way either, as the coconut oil and especially the beeswax nicely overpower.  And my lips are feeling great this winter!",Neutral
"I am a big fan of Jem and I love the way it is so spreadable. This is the first time I tried the Coconut Cardamom flavor and I loved the flavor, but after the first use and I put it in the fridge, it was hard as rock and not spreadable at all. Flavor was fantastic and I did not have the problem with the Cinnamon Maca flavor - it spread like a dream down to the last drop.",Neutral
"Certainly a great British tea product. Traditionally, such products come to the customers with at least one to two years for shelf life freshness. This end-of-the-2009-year purchase (six big boxes!) provided me with the product expiring in June 2010. Somewhat short of my expectations; all the more so, expiration dates are clearly written on the boxes and, I am sure, processing staff could easily note this.",Neutral
"The flavor of the tea is strong and smooth, and a flavor that you would expect in a good English Breakfast Tea.

"When my local grocery store stopped carrying my favorite avacado oil I started a search for a new favorite. I typically use it to make homemade mayo so I prefer a mild creamy flavor. This is far from mild or creamy. It gave my mayo a pungent almost bitter taste the was more like olive oil than avocado oil. In the past, quality oils have turned my mayo slightly greeninsh, this stuff turned it an odd bright yellow which does make me doubt the quality of the product.",Neutral
"Tastes good, but according to most websites that I have read, avocado oil is SUPPOSED to have a HIGH smoke point...like over 500°!!! But, when you visit THIS manufacturers website, it lists their oil as having a smoke point of just 350°. I have written the manufacturer, I will post an update soon. This is puzzling to say the least.",Neutral
"I got this based on the all the positive reviews and was so excited to try this out since I love avocados.  The day I got this, I poured some in a small dish and tried using it as a dipping oil with bread.  I normally use olive oil and love it but love trying new things and was looking forward to this since others said the taste was great.  Well I personally did not like it all as a dipping oil.  I could not get past the first bite of bread and immediately dumped it and got the olive oil.  I've used it in saut&eacute;ing dishes and it is fine for that purpose.  I don't fry food at home so I've never used this other than in regular cooking.  THis is a decent oil if you are in the search for different products to try but I personally prefer olive oil for dipping and cooking and prefer walnut oil for salad dressings.  This is decent but I probably wouldn't buy it again.",Neutral
"The oil seems to be of good quality, but when I received the package, one of the cans was so badly dented that I just threw it away. There were plenty of airbags packed around the cans and the box wasn't dented or creased, so I think one of the cans was already dented before it was shipped. When a can is dented, heavy metal leaches into the product. I feel a bit cheated.",Neutral

The other can is too dented for me to consider gift-worthy.  I can't attest to the quality of the oil yet, because I haven't used it and nor has she.. I just wanted to get this review out to let people know that your cans will most like come dented in some way or an other.  In fact, mine came in a big box from Amazon with a few other purchases; Amazon seemed to wrap it well, but my guess is that the cans were dented before Amazon shipped them to me.",Neutral
"Previously, I had sampled Lester's Fixins <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0079KZ9AK"">Sweet Corn Soda</a>, a rather bizarre beverage.  Now, with Buffalo Wing Soda in hand, I was about to imbibe yet another dubious offering from ol' Lester.  With slight trepidation, I pried the bottle cap off of this evil beverage and took a sniff --""Okay,"" I foolishly thought to myself, ""it smells a little bit strange, but not as bad as I expected."" (I was in denial)!  Finally, I took my first swig...  In reality, it tasted sort of like a citrus soda that had been spiked with a couple teaspoons of hot sauce.  The spiciness gave a slight burning sensation to my esophagus, and a funky aftertaste lingered for a while after I had finished the beverage. Subsequently, ""rot gut"" began to settle in, and any lingering ""open mindedness"" that I still had toward this soda faded away exponentially...<br />As I type this review, the empty bottle sits next to me; I've now become acutely and unequivocally aware of the noxious smell continually wafting from the opening:  An unsettling hybrid scent of hot sauce and sickly sweetness.<br /><br />I like the novelity of this soda, but I don't think that I'll be drinking it again.",Neutral

I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.

"Years ago, when living on the east coast I suffered from asthma despite the fact that I was on four different medications.  After moving here to Arizona, I've been able to completely take myself off of all medications.  More recently however, my father passed away and apparently my emotional reaction triggered one of the worst asthma attacks I've had in years.  For the past two weeks, I've been gasping for air even after walking a short distance and could not even say a few words to people without gasping for air and panting.  My asthma became so bad this time that I contemplated going to the emergency room because I felt like I was going to pass out.  Instead what I did was do breathing exercises, bio-feedback, meditation and prayer.  While in the health food store I came across this tea, purchased it and staggered home to prepare it.  After drinking some, I noticed a little difference in breathing after about 30 minutes.  But I was thinking that it may not be the tea but simply because I sat down and relaxed for a while.  After drinking 3 or 4 cups of this tea a day using two tea bags, I honestly did not notice any significant difference in breathing.  The only thing significantly different was the fact that I started coughing up more flim, but that just could be that the asthma attack was running its course or the fact that I was drinking more fluids.<br /><br />The tea definately tastes good.  It has slight mint flavor which cools your mouth when the air is drawn in.  There is also a slight sweet and pleasant bitter taste to it.<br /><br />I quickly finished up two boxes of this tea.  I may buy some more later because I really like the taste.  As far as it treating asthma and other respiratory problems, it was simply hard to tell.  IF YOU ARE HAVING AN ASTHMA ATTACK, THIS TEA WILL NOT RESTORE FREE BREATHING.<br /><br />Only a few days ago, my asthma has been dramatically clearing up.  I worked out yesterday and am able to do strenuous exercise without panting and wheezing like I was doing last week.  I very seriously doubt that the tea had a delayed effect.  Last week, I didn't want to do it but I staggered into a drug store and purchased an inhaler (I hate using those things because they contain epinephrine).  I had two choices, either I keep suffering and kill myself or restore my breathing.",Neutral

"I never, ever drink 'diet' sodas and try to avoid most soda in general.  However, I do really enjoy <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBW50G"">Blue Sky Organic New Century Cola</a> and was curious to try a sugar-free version.  Ultimately, I decided to go with the root beer 'free' soda over a cola because I figured the stronger taste would better cover any strange stevia taste or aftertaste.  I don't buy or consume stevia in other products so I'm not really sure how it tastes on its own, but it's really not bad in this soda.  It also doesn't dry out your mouth like other sweeteners.  This soda definitely has a unique taste but, as another reviewer pointed out, I think you are mostly tasting the ""french sweet birch oil"" per the ingredient list.  It also lists tahitian vanilla, hence the 'creamy' aspect.  The ingredients are quality and while it still has zero nutritional value, it's a better bet over regular or other diet sodas by a long shot.<br /><br />One thing I do not like is the misleading description: yes the soda does contain stevia as a sweetener but it is the second to last ingredient on the list.  The second ingredient out of seven is erythritol, which is a sugar alcohol, and NOT how this product is advertised to be sweetened.  Via wikipedia, it is ""60-70% as sweet as table sugar yet it is almost non-caloric, does not affect blood sugar, does not cause tooth decay, and is absorbed by the body, therefore unlikely to cause gastric side effects unlike other sugar alcohols.""  However, I bought this product because I wanted a natural (Stevia leaf) sweetened product rather than another lab-generated chemical.  Disappointed.  I'll probably continue to drink them over time, but will not be reordering.  The stevia content is minimal at best, with the main ingredients being filtered water and erythritol.  I'd rather consume 100 more calories and drink the natural and organic regular Blue Sky cola or root beer.<br /><br />You ARE still consuming an artificially-sweetened-with-chemicals drink!  If you're okay with that, the taste is nice.  But if, like me, that is exactly what you are trying to avoid, this product is not it.",Neutral

"I drink a lot of Earl Grey tea and have tried four or five brands over the years, Bigelow being my favorite.  I've been trying this organic Rishi tea for two weeks now and have experimented with different amounts of tea to get the flavor right and have not been able to. It is just okay for me. This tea is advertised as a bold tea and I see that many reviewers agree but I do not.  If I add too much tea to try to make it stronger it adversely affects the taste unlike other loose teas I use.  Also, this tea requires 1 TBL of dry tea per 8oz of water; I need to use twice that amount for it not to be weak, whereas other loose teas I use only require 1 1/2 tsp. for the same strength, so this Rishi tea would be much more expensive to use regularly.  I may prepare it occasionally just to have a change once in awhile.<br /><br />The packaging is beautiful.  It is packed in a very nice earthy looking tin and is slender and tall so fits in the cabinet nicely.  The big plus with this tea is that it's organic.",Neutral

Honey did not work for me with this tea; however, I found aspertame to work surprisingly well (Aspertame is usually one of my least favorite sweeteners).<br /><br />The brewing instructions are simple and work well.<br /><br />It would be nice to have the option of buying this tea in tea-bag form.<br /><br />To sum up, this tea is a quality product with good taste, from a good source, but otherwise unexceptional.",Neutral
"First of all- I love tea, particularly Earl Grey and variations of Earl Grey...<br /><br />This tea contains Yunnan province black tea and bergamot essential oil.<br /><br />This is a loose tea and the packaging is lovely.  While I have had many loose teas that come in tins, I do appreciate that under the outer cap, this tin has an additional metal stopper that is very easily removed but also prevents an explosion of tea leaves.<br /><br />The stopper not only serves as a seal, it is also useful in measuring the tea for brewing- this little inner stopper holds approximately 1 Tablespoon of tea (not packed, fairly loose...I measured it as I was curious...) which is the recommended amount for 8oz of water and proper brewing... Many folks do not like tea because they have not had properly brewed tea, so this is an impressive extra measure to ensure the brew is as intended...<br /><br />When you open the container the bergamot hits you in the face...I was hoping the overwhelming bergamot would settle down during the brew, but I still found that it was overwhelming to the point of being excessively perfumey (for me it was like being trapped in a small space with someone who bathed in a bottle of eau de anything)... It was quite drinkable when I attempted to get past the bergamot slap, and the Yunnan black tea was smooth and rich and delightful...Not bitter in the least, and very flavorful and tasty... Unfortunately, I could not get past the overwhelming bergamot... But I plan on trying some of Rishi Tea's other varieties as I do like this varietal of Yunnan black tea...<br /><br />I do also appreciate that this is USDA organic, Fair Trade certified and the tin tells the story of the tea and the people who cultivate it...<br /><br />I prefer my Earl Grey to be more balanced, with the tea aspect or the bergamot in harmony....",Neutral
"Had to get a tea ball for the loose tea.  This is for a true tea afficianado who can appreciate the art of making tea.  Clearly, this tea being organic, the tin being so decorative, and the purchase putatively benefiting a specific tea growing region allows certain tea afficianados to have a mental appreciation for the background of the tea while drinking it.<br />I drink Earl Grey as a pick me up in the afternoon.  This one is comparable in taste to other Earl Greys on the market.",Neutral
"While not the finest Earl Grey out there, it sure is packaged for maximum appeal.  The petite cylindrical canister  is sized just right for glorified-spice-rack tea cabinet storage, with artwork that's just short of overwrought. Pop off the top, and lo: it's double-hulled, requiring an extra bit of effort for each pot brewed.  Special!  This second satisfying-pop comes complete with a wallop of sharp, nose-tingling bergamot.<br />Regular tea drinkers may find Rishi's Earl Grey most suitable as garnish to a darker, fuller-bodied tea (a couple of spoons on top of some PG Tips makes for a nice afternoon pick-me-up). Otherwise they may find they go through a can a week, at best.<br /><br />Alone, this tea brews to an orangeish hue, no darker, and always tastes slightly understeeped, or overmilked.  I tried to oversteep, but no dice: It's as if the tea's been neutered, the merest hint of tannin erased. It's unnerving.<br /><br />If you want a tea that will pretty much always present pretty well, and are willing to pay extra for that pritnear peace of mind, Rishi's Earl Grey is a good bet.  If you like more involvement with your tea -- attention to leaf volume, water temperature, steeping time, ratio of additives, etc. -- stick with Twinings, Numi, or Taylors of Harrogate.",Neutral

I haven't changed anything in my diet to explain this sudden increase so I do believe it was the use of the new pills.<br /><br />I think the first bottle may have been older and so the capsules may have lost their potency.

"This is a great grain free, alternate protein dog food.  We've been using it for years for a pup that seems to have every food allergy under the sun, and he's thrived on it.<br /><br />In one month (Aug-September, however, the price jumped from $59.99 to over $78.00 (for you non-math people that's a 30% increase).<br /><br />This bag was the anchor of my monthly Amazon order, but now that the price has made it un-economical to buy through Amazon, I will parcel out my orders to have a more economical result.",Neutral

We have similar tastes, is what I'm trying to say. The beef and fish meal gives her the worst fish breath imaginable. I don't know if the food causes her to want to try giving me face kisses more than normal, but every time she gets near me after eating this her breath is like a shotgun of stank.",Neutral
"I have been feeding Canidae for a long time, and when my local carrier raised their prices to $70+ without taxes, I figured I needed to start buying online.  The food quality was the same as the bags I bought in stores, and it is a great food overall.  The only issues I have had are with the delivery.  One of the bags I bought was broke open, so when I took the bag out of the shipping box, dog food went everywhere.  The delivery time is also something that needs improvement.  I placed my order on the 10th, and it didn't start to ship until the 17th.  It took a week before it even left the facility.  It is supposed to arrive a week after the 17th, which means it will have taken 2 weeks to get my delivery.  Not a big deal if you are waiting on something frivalous, but food for you pets should be delivered more quickly.",Neutral
"My baby is a wonderful eater and has loved all of the variety I've given him until this food. He tried it and vomited instantly. I tried the next day and just let him smell it and he vomited again - lol. I tried it too and it was not tasty to me at all. I had two of these packs left so I waited a couple of weeks to try again. He liked it that time. Anyway, don't give up and keep trying because they just may like it after a few tries (or even 15 tries). It's a healthy meal.",Neutral
The ingredients are just great that's why I ordered it but when I opened the pouch and tasted... I know it's very healthy but this meal is not eatable.  I have ended up adding few spoons to meals I cook or just other baby food but this is it.,Neutral
"We bought a 16 pack and have 13 left.  Of the 3 that we tried, she never once finished a single pouch.  I tried it and was really surprised because it is well seasoned with herbs and spices compared to other things she will eat.  It could be the texture - I don't know.  It's a little mushy, like baby food.  Probably would be better with pasta instead of amaranth, although I appreciate the diversity of grains.  Anyway, I love it, she hates it, so 3 stars.",Neutral
"My son is not a picky eater, but he really doesn't like this flavor.  I love the HappyBaby brand in general and so does my son, who is 11 months old.  I'm not saying this is a bad product, but I definitely would not buy it in bulk before you let your child try it.  You are much safer doing that with the fruit/veggie mixes.  Try before you buy seems like common sense.  However, the only store that carries this brand locally for me (Target) has a very limited selection so I couldn't let my son try this flavor before I bought it.  I imagine that is the same for other people shopping on-line.  I thought I could mix it with something else if he didn't care for it, but he will have nothing to do with it, mixed or otherwise.  I have to say that I agree with another review that says it looks & smells like cat food.  I try all of the food I feed my son and thought this product was bland, bordering on bad tasting.  I give it 3 stars, because I think this product is definitely not for everyone, and more of an acquired taste.  I highly recommend HappyBaby though!",Neutral
"My 18 month old likes them, but he will eat pretty much antying. My pediatrician suggested increasing my 3 year old's protein. I saw these online and saw they have a ton of protien.<br />They arrived in the mail right away, and my 3 year old is not a big fan. She loves the Plumb brand fruit and veggie pouches and likes to suck them straight from the pouch. It is not very easy to suck it straight out of these pouches. I have been able to cut a small spot on the corner to make it work, but putting it in a bowl and using a spoon made it loose much of the thrill.<br />My 18 month old likes them, but I'm not sure I'll get my older one on the band wagon.",Neutral
"My daughter did not like this flavor, she will eat it with a little bit of vegetable or fruit puree every other bite.  It is a bit of a struggle, and honestly it is a strong fishy smell coming out of the package.  This is also a chunkier and drier pouch compared to the other flavors.",Neutral
"I really like the Happy Baby ""Chick Chick"" pouches and thought this would be a great way to introduce seafood to our baby. However, the consistency is much different - much thicker than the chicken pouch, and the smell! Well you definitely know it's seafood!

But, I don't think we'll be buying this flavor again.",Neutral
we tried some other organic baby foods lately and she loved them but unfortunately she hates HATES HATES this food.  She's never had such a reaction to any food before but actually cried and screamed at the first taste of this.  I guess it's just not for her.  We've given her other foods from happy baby and she's loved them but this one she will not eat.  Too bad I bought a huge package!,Neutral
"My baby loves Happy Baby's Chick Chick meal, so we tried the salmon. It is the first food that my 11 month old has ever spit back at me.

It's too bad that you can only purchase them in lots of 16.... lots of leftover salmon here.",Neutral

I got a few different flavors of the HAPPYBABY food and this one in particular causes my daughter to gag and vomit. My daughter does not have a weak stomach by any means and eats a lot of different foods. But for whatever reason when she eats this flavor it comes right back out. After the third try I am giving up and concluding there is something wrong with this item.<br /><br />Even more disappointed that there is no option to return it with Amazon. I did however reach out to HAPPYBABY directly and are working with them to make this purchase a positive experience. For that I have changed my review from 1 stars to 3 stars.<br /><br />For now I will stick with the Chick Chick and Gobble Gobble flavors!,Neutral
"I generally make all of LO's food organic from scratch (yes, I work full-time, but this is important to me, so I make the time).  However, I've tried a few pre-packaged foods...and while LO loves the taste of Chick Chick, and I like that it is more well-rounded than most others, I absolutely hate this packaging.  If my little one decides he doesn't want to finish the package after three bites, the rest is total waste...or I have to scoop it into a different container to store until he's ready to finish.<br />Absolutely love the item, but hate the packaging.",Neutral
"It smells delicious but unfortunately my 11 month old was having problems with the Amaranth.  He does eat some finger foods - mango, peaches, carrots, etc... but for some reason he was having problems with the Amaranth - maybe it was too grainy for him.  Will try it down the road again.",Neutral
"I bought this flavor along with two others and was surprised at how different the texture was compared to Chick Chick and Super Salmon. It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands. I will just need to remember to pack some sandwich baggies in case it not working out when trying to eat it on the go.",Neutral
"I loved the stage 2 Spinach Mango Pear, although I found it too watery.  I had to add rice to get baby to eat it.  I got the stage 3 mama grain based on the fact that it is suggested for 7 month olds.  My baby is 9 months old and won't eat it.  I disagree that it tastes awful.  I'd eat it myself, but it is way too thick.  I got a case of it, so I'm going make it work.  So- I put the too watery stage 2 spinach mango pear and stage 3 mama grain in the blender and voila! Perfect texture.  Easy enough fix, however- I buy premade baby food because I don't want to blend my own.  I did with my 1st baby, but this is my 4th, and the novelty of making baby food, and the time required to do it- is long gone.  Happy Baby would do well to be more consistent in their labeling.  Their Stage 2 food should be 1.5, and this stage 3 should be 3.75.",Neutral
"My twin boys have loved this product - they gobbled it up.  And as a mom, I loved it because it was very tasty and unique.  But also because it used a lot of veggies that my boys don't often get in their diet, like peppers and eggplant.  Since I last bought this product on Amazon the entire recipe has changed and there is no indication of such in the Amazon description.  It now is almost all carrots (something that my boys eat constantly) and quinoa.  No eggplant.  Only red peppers as one of the last ingredients.  And amaranth, for which it is named, went from ingredient number two, to the end of the ingredient list just above the spices.  It is not nearly as tasty in my opinion, either.  It looks and tastes a lot more like the Super Salmon.To be honest, this is just an entirely different product.  My boys still eat it, but I was disappointed and might not buy it again.",Neutral
"Unfortunately they changed the recipe up on our baby....he looooooved this, it was a great trainer food as it was thicker now it's just runy like the chick chick one which we stopped buying.  One taste of the new formula and baby turned up his nose and didn't want anymore....I was presistant and eventually the only way he'll eat it is with bread dipped in it or his veggie stix dipped in it and I have to sneak in spoonfulls here and there.  It's just too runny for our baby boy now, he's older now but we still want to make sure he's getting salmon atleast once a week.  This is the most convenient for us so we still give it to him at 20 months.  I'm going to hunt down the original forumla's and stock up whenever I see them!  Other than that, we are a 100% HappyBaby family and love all the wonderful products they continue to make!",Neutral
"I was a big fan of this product since it was the only baby food that contained salmon until the ingredient was changed. The decrease in the protein content from 4g (old) to 1g (new) makes me wonder how much salmon is actually in this pouch. I can even tell from the smell of the new version which doesn't smell like fish at all that there is very little salmon in it. Also, the new version added apples and increased the sugar content from 0g(old) to 3g(new) which I am not happy about.<br />My son still loves this pouch, but I purchased this product for nutritious reasons - very disappointed with the change!",Neutral

"I had the opportunity to use this a few times at various homes/establishments.  I found it to work great every time, quickly producing a good cup of coffee.  The product it brews is standard and is always good.<br /><br />It just seems a little bit wasteful to have to throw away a k-cup after every use.  Sure, there are refillable k-cups, but all of the packaging/plastic from the standard k-cups seems silly.  Does it really take that much less time than it takes to brew a standard pot of coffee?

"I'm on my third one, the price has dropped over the years but I also fear the quality has too. Must be made in China.  I bought this new one only 3 months ago and while it was cheaper than the past 2 I owned it is now failing. I think the ""Microprocessor Controlled Technology"" that ""maintains water at the perfect brewing temperature "" has failed? Who knows? it works 1/2 the time now, the other half it won't deliver any water. Next week I'll bet I'll be looking for a new one. Bottom line: If you only make 1 cup of coffee a day I'm sure they will last forever but apparently they are not built strong enough to withstand heavy use.",Neutral
"I got this Keurig for my mom as a christmas gift. I picked it initially because it was one of the more affordable, nicer ones. From what I can see its, great! it makes coffee almost instantly. The only thing I noticed is this Keurig is made cheaper than the more expensive ones, for example I own the 179.99 Keurig and the handle and base are made out of metal while this one's handle and base are made out of plastic. Its not necessarily a bad thing its just something I noticed. And its kind of unfortunate that it only allows you to choose two sizes of coffee and thats it. Basically what i'm trying to say is for someone like me whose a mild coffee drinker its great! But for someone who drinks coffee more often you might want to spring for one of the more expensive ones that allow you to be specific on different settings such as cup size and temperature.",Neutral

"Yes, I did purchase 12 6-Ounce packets of Claey's Root Beer Drops. The reasons I think they are just okay are my own.  Late night computer shopping sometimes makes me order haphazardly.  I like the candies fine.  They have an intense anise flavor, which borders on strong licorice.  They are not individually wrapped, which is stated right on the order page, but I overlooked.  They are coated with dried sugars, much like a lemon drop.  The candies get softer as you consume them, which plays hard-ball with my dental work.  They taste delicious, but I find them harder to carry around with me everywhere I go.",Neutral
I agree with the other reviewer about these tasting nothing like a real latte. The Maxwell House ones are much much better. The problem is that the vanilla flavor that they used to flavor the espresso is extremely strong and powerful but it has such an artificial taste to it. Brewing it did give my house a wonderful vanilla fragrance and it didn't taste completely horrible which is why I am giving it some stars...I will drink the rest of the package however...I would never buy this again. The plain lattes with a little bit of vanilla syrup are exponentially better. I do have to say that the creamer that comes with this though is the best creamer I have had from the tassimo line. That said...I won't pay this price just for a slightly sweeter creamer disc.,Neutral

"Just to keep it simple...more of a comparison than a total review.  I love jalapeno chips - look mostly for the level of spice, then pepper flavor, good crunch, and not loaded down with salt.<br /><br />With that said, these Deep River Snacks chips (jalapeno flavor) are:<br />1. Better than the Lays Jalapeno.  (Deep RIver have the same spice level, which is lacking.  Neither have a lot of pepper flavor.)<br />2. About the same as the jalapeno chips that the ""World Market"" branded chips.  (World Market has a little more spice, but also a lot more salt.)<br />3. Not nearly as good as Tim's Cascade Jalapeno chips.  (Tims has more pepper flavor, more spice, a little bit better crunch...but also have MSG.)<br /><br />It's not to say these chips are bad, but just what the 3-stars says ""It's OK.""  There are better, there are worse...to me, these are right in the middle of the pack.",Neutral
"I was expecting some ""serious flavor"" as it was advertised on the bag.. but compared to other jalapeno chips I've had, it's pretty bland. The ingredients list is short, which is a plus, and it's fairly low in sodium (160mg per 1oz serving) which is probably why I prefer this less, as I like saltier chips. Overall I'd say this is a good choice if you like a healthier version of a jalapeno chip.. but if you like strong flavor like I do, stick with Kettle brand jalapeno chips.",Neutral
"Olive oil in large bold print on the front of the bag is misleading!!  Olive oil is NOT the main oil the chips are cooked in.

"I ordered these because I had purchased a bag of Sweet maui Onion chips from the supermarket. They were so good that I had to get another.<br /><br />The order came and I popped open a bag.

I've only had this happen once before, with another brand of lightly roasted espresso.  I tried the espresso a couple of times, hoping that something else was causing the reflux, but alas it was this yummy espresso.  I really prefer the medium roast to the dark roast, but I had to go back to my organic beans (and my reflux went away).  But if reflux is not a problem for you, this stuff is really great.

"This is absolutely based on personal preference, but I feel a little disappointed with this tea. Raised on a strong pallet of black teas, I don't really have an appreciation for lighter teas, and barley bases are almost tasteless to me.

"Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers).

The girl, Crystal, is the pickier of the pair and will usually lick a little of the food or sauce before abandoning any soft food (leaving the remnants for Otis), but would not touch this product. I was gratified to see that the product did not come out of China after the problems of the past year.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the cats did not seem to like the product as much as other soft foods.

It kinda looked like tuna with peas & carrots, although it was really juicy (seemed like almost half the can was just liquid).  Anyway long story short the cats devoured this food when we first gave it to 'em.  However I must admit the cans were a little small for 2 cats, but a can this size would be perfect for a 1 cat family.  (Here comes the only 3 star rating part)  Anyway, after the 1st couple cans it seemed as though the cats loved it, but then, all of a sudden they just stopped eating it.  I gotta tell you with my cats that's a rare thing to be sure.  Everytime we've tried to give it to 'em since they've completely turned their noses from it.  I can't really say that this stuff isn't good, all I know is that suddenly my cats stopped liking it, your cats might love it.  Granted, my cats are used to the mushy stuff I mentioned earlier, but to be fare they also like canned tuna/chicken (it could just be the big veggie chunks they didn't like, who knows).  I guess in closing, it's kinda up in the air as to whether or not you'll get the most out of your purchase or not, I know I won't ever buy it again, but again your cats might love it, kinda hard to come to a real definative conclusion:(.",Neutral
"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.

We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days.

Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.

"This is basically shredded white chicken in a seasoned gravy like broth. ALL 5 of my cats inhaled it and licked their bowls clean. It appears as human grade food. That said,and since it is not organic, it is more cost effective to buy a can of broth, add some seasoning and add a mashed can of chicken. I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off. Just a note-the greatly higher amount of chicken you get in this flavor vs. the pot pie watery flavor is considerable.",Neutral
"Of my three cats, only one likes this food. I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing-looking, and it does appear to be as advertised- All natural- it's also not very popular in my household.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak broth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken-mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.<br /><br />Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!<br /><br />My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24-pack like this.<br /><br />I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.<br /><br />...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.<br /><br />Remove the carrots, thicken the ""sauce"" and you might have something here.",Neutral
"I have been giving this food to my cat for a couple of days, and I have mixed feelings about it. The chicken pot pie flavor has a lot of broth in it. Fortunately, my cat likes broth, and whenever I buy food that has either a lot of sauce or a lot of broth, my cat enjoys the extra moisture. However, this depends on your cat. What I found, however, is that the chicken pot pie has more broth than actual food.  The chicken is very chunky and looks very natural, and is exactly the consistency my cat enjoys.  However, it contains carrots, and my cat doesn't really eat vegetables. Cats in general don't eat vegetables, because they are naturally carnivores, so I question its inclusion.<br /><br />The Chinese Chicken is actually ""sesame"". It has a slightly odd aroma, which doesn't seem to bother my cat, and plenty of sauce, which my cat enjoys. However, the meat in this flavor is shredded, which my cat does not enjoy. It has fewer vegetables than the chicken pot pie, but my cat will barely touch the meat in this.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective, these foods have about the same (or slightly better) protein content than my cat's regular brands. This is a plus, especially if you have an overweight cat. This food contains plenty of protein and plenty of moisture, which are really critical in quality cat food.<br /><br />Based on what I've seen, I would conclude that these are quality cat foods. They look better than what my cat eats on a regular basis. Ultimately, though, it depends what your cat enjoys -- consider the consistencies I've described before buying. In my situation, since my cat will not eat the Chinese ""Sesame"" Chicken, I have quite a few cans of food that I will not be able to use -- an issue of the mult-flavor, multi-pack design.",Neutral
"I do have to say that the cat food is quite nutritious and appealed to my cat's sense of smell as well as my visual sense.  He also did not throw up this food, which is a rarity for my sensitive-stomached cat.  On the downside, he didn't eat much of it, either.  I don't know what about it didn't interest him beyond a few bites, but most of it got left in his bowl.  My dog, on the other hand, loves it!  I give three stars because it's potentially interesting to other cats, but mine wouldn't eat more than a little bit of it.  I gave some to a friend, and her cats loved it.",Neutral
"I typically feed them dry food, and once a day I split a can of Fancy Feast to give them a treat with their supper.<br />They love it. They have never turned down any canned cat food. Sometimes one will refuse or just nibble at a particular flavor, but they usually like their canned food<br /><br />I tried out both flavors on my three kitties, None of them did more than nibble, I tried it on my dog, just out of curiosity, He ate it . Continuing my experiment, I went to my friend Margie's house. She has three cats as well. Much like my feline family, one is a senior and two are young. Sadly, I had the same result. None of them liked it.<br /><br />Before receiving the food I looked online to learn as much as I could about this food before subjecting my furkids to it. Everything looked good, safe and worthy of Morgan, Rosie and Emmie. I was quite disappointed that they don't like it, to tell you the truth. It looked so good that I really wanted them to like it.I will be dropping off the rest of it at the shelter tomorrow. I certainly do not want it to go to waste, as it is a good quality product.",Neutral
"One of my cats liked this food, although not as much as he liked the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food, and my other cat wouldn't touch this food; however, she does like the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety. This variety of food comes with chunks of chicken, chunks of vegetables and gravy. I'm guessing my finicky cat was turned off by the vegetable chunks. On the positive side these cans are easy to open and you can pour the food out without having to use a spoon. However, because one of my cats wouldn't touch this food I won't buy it again. I'll stick with the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food.",Neutral
"At almost a dollar for one TINY can (the same exact size as a fancy feast) I would personally never buy this product; it just isn't worth it. I was glad that I ended up picking this from the Vine program because my cat did like the Chinese Chicken one. She devoured that in an instant and licked the bowl clean. She wasn't all that impressed with the Chicken Pot Pie. It was very watery and there wasn't much in the can.<br /><br />My cat 99% of the time eats fancy feast, and I usually split the can in half. Half in the morning, half when I get home from work, and half before I go to bed. But with these cans (which, again, are the same size), there is no way you can split them. I gave her the whole can at once. It just isn't worth it, for this price.<br /><br />On the plus side, the food actually smells good-like human food almost. It even looks good-for cat food. Probably one of the best looking types of cat food I've ever come across.<br /><br />So out of 24 expensive cans, my cat likes only half of them. It would be nicer if they had different varieties in the case, not just 2. However, I think for the most part, cats would generally like this cat food.",Neutral
"My gang is typically not very fussy when it comes to food - if it doesn't move (or, at least move too much) they'll eat it. So, I was pretty sure they'd like this up-scale food.<br /><br />Surprisingly, one did not - while she didn't turn up her nose at it, she didn't really want to eat it either.  The other three gave it their licked-clean food bowl seal of approval.<br /><br />The cans are small (the ""mini"" can size much like Fancy Feast) which is a good match for single cat households since you don't have to deal with leftovers. The smell is much better than the low-cost can foods, and about on a par with the more premium brands such as Hills. The chicken pot pie was VERY watery, however - more like a soup than a stew. The sesame chicken was a bit more solid. The watery nature of the product also makes it messy to serve. To me, it's not a very good value especially considering that you're paying for a lot of water.<br /><br />I don't think I'd get this again given the cost and the mess factor, plus the fact that  there are several other brands that provide top-notch nutrition at a lower cost (and less mess). I also try to purchase items that are US-made, and this is made in Thailand. But, the majority of the cats snarfed it down, so it's deserving of at least 3 stars.",Neutral
"While several reviewers have alluded to the healthfulness of this product, I think that we owe it to our beloved pets to pay closer attention and educate ourselves about the actual ingredients.<br /><br />The overall appearance gives an allure of wholesomeness to this product, but an item listed in the ingredients is actually controversial with regards to our pets' health. (And if you're considering this food good enough for your own consumption, please note that the ingredient is also potentially toxic to human organs).<br /><br />Here's the list of ingredients, from the manufacturer's website:<br /><br />Fish broth<br />Tuna fillets<br />Yellow fin whole loin tuna/red snapper/shrimp/sole<br />Soy bean oil<br />Trialcium phosphate<br />Guar gum<br />Calcium sulfate<br />Carrageenan<br />Vitamins and Minerals<br />Vitamin E supplement<br />Vitamin A supplement<br />Vitamin D3 supplement<br />Zinc Sulfate<br />Thiamine Mononitrate<br />Manganese sulfate<br />Menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of vitamin K activity)<br />Riboflavin supplement<br />Folic acid<br />Pyridoxine hydrochloride<br />Copper amino acid complex<br />Iron amino acid complex<br /><br />First of all, it's great that the manufacturer has whole seafood as the major ingredients (as opposed to the by-products, meal, grains, etc). But there is one item which I would not have expected to find in something of this quality: Menadione sodium bisuifite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for the K vitamins and has been reported, at high doses, to have toxic effects. Moreover, I had actually never seen menadione listed as an ingredient in other cat foods (though there seem to be others out there).<br /><br />A little bit of Internet sleuthing yielded some disturbing information, which I feel obliged to list here.<br /><br />*Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />*There are safer alternatives to menadione for proper K vitamin-related functions (e.g. blood clotting). The use of menadione over the alternatives (leafy greens, kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food.<br /><br />*A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />*Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />There seems to be a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of menadione in pet food: [...]<br /><br />Does this information mean that this food is bad for our cats, when normal doses are given? I don't know for sure, but I wish that I'd been more aware about this ingredient before feeding it to my cats. Admittedly, more research needs to be done regarding this subject. In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I'm erring on the side of caution on this one.",Neutral
"The first test for a new canned cat food is the ingredient list.  The ingredients in Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (chicken flavors) passed this test with flying colors: Chicken, Chicken Broth, Carrots are listed first and there is no wheat gluten. Unfortntately, the 2nd test is whether my cat will eat the food and this ended up with a big thumbs down. Not sure if it was the significant amount of broth in a serving or the fact that it is chicken (he usually has fish-based canned food), but after a 1st bite, he just walked away.<br /><br />If a cat is accustomed to eating chicken canned food, I would still recommend giving this a try because of the quality ingredients.",Neutral
"Petite Cuisine is a proposed competitor to Fancy Feast.  Insofar as taste, well, my cat, Matt, will eat anything, and this is no exception.  He plowed right through all four flavors:  red snapper, tuna and sole, tuna and shrimp and yellow fin tuna.  Matt is a food addict, and I have to control his intake, giving him four measured meals a day.  Only one of those meals per day is a half of a 3 ounce can of Fancy Feast or a worthwhile substitute.  The caloric intake is such that giving him any more than that would double his already 17 pound size.<br /><br />In any case, I compared the Guarantee Analysis of Fancy Feast to Petite Cuisine, and here are the numbers:<br /><br />1.  Crude protein:  Fancy Feast...minimum 14.0%; Petite Cuisine...13%.<br />2.  Crude fat:  Fancy Feast...minimum 3.0%; Petite Cuisine...1.5%.<br />3.  Crude fiber:  Fancy Feast...maximum 1.5%; Petite Cuisine...1%.<br />4.  Moisture:  Fancy Feast...maximum 78.0%; Petite Cuisine...85%.<br />5.  Ash:  Fancy Feast...maximum 3.5%; Petite Cuisine...3%.<br />6.  Taurine:  Fancy Feast...minimum 0.05%; Petite Cuisine...0.1%.<br /><br />In particular, I noticed that Petite Cuisine is much runnier than Fancy Feast, which has a fairly thick consistency in ground varieties and much thicker gravy in those versions as well.  All together and based upon the comparison of content, I would prefer to purchase Fancy Feast; however, another factor you should consider is overall cost, especially if you are feeding more than one cat.",Neutral
"This cat food looks and smells a lot like the Fancy Feast premium brand, Garden Medley, that comes in the green cans. (Amazing that Fancy Feast, already an expensive, premium brand, would have an even more upscale variety that's even more expensive.) It almost looks like people food. I have eight cats and two ate it immediately and the other six walked away. In the morning, I would find the bowls empty (this is not always the case with other foods, even when they're hungry, they'll ignore some things). I don't know if others changed their minds, or the two who pretty much eat anything came back and cleaned it up. I can't compare prices with this brand because I have never seen it in any store (I live on the East Coast in Virginia, it must be a West Coast brand.)<br /><br />I was put off by the big Made in Thailand lettering on the box because I lived there for two years and it's not a clean country. I was a little worried about what actually was in this food.<br /><br />Since I don't buy Garden Medley because I can't afford it, and I suspect this is in the same price range, I can't honestly say I would buy it. But if your cat loves Garden Medley, and this is a better buy, then it's a good deal.",Neutral
"UPDATE to the review below: First I'd like to downgrade this to a two star, but the system won't let me...well, would a 1 & 1/2 actually, but it really won't let me do that.<br /><br />NEITHER cat ever became fond of this, and we stopped using it completely when I found two 1"" bones and several smaller bone chunks in one of the cans of the ""Snapper"" flavour.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: We have two cats: Bruegel, a 16 year old female who is very petite and very picky, and Banjo, a 7 year old male who is very large and quite indiscriminate in his choice of what to eat. Bruegie mostly only likes wet food especially tuna (Sheba Tuna entr&eacute;e is her favorite)...oh, and cheese; we call her the cheese-monger. Banjo mostly likes dry food; he has become carbo-kittie...he begs for bread and crackers.<br /><br />Now that the intended consumers have been introduced, here's their review: Eh, I'm bored.<br /><br />When I looked at the can, I was overjoyed. No wheat gluten and all natural ingredients plus a few vitamins. When I opened the first can, I was even happier; Bruegie likes the foods with more liquid in them and these are fish chunks and lots of liquid. However, when I set the plates down, they were ignored. When it was time for clean-up, most of the food was still there. We have now gone through every flavour in the box...with the same result.<br /><br />The first time we set down a can of Sheba (which wasn't too long ago) Bruegie was all over it and Banjo tried to muscle in. When we are feeding her something she can tell is her favorite (from the smell when we open the can, I suppose,) Bruegie will beg...none of that.<br /><br />All that said, as any cat owner will tell you, EVERY cat is different... and next week, we might be looking at clean plates, but for now the Capehart-Stephenson Kitties are having none of this. The three stars are for the ingredients, hopefully your cats will like it more than ours.",Neutral
"This variety pack came to us as an Amazon Vine program sample.  Our two cats have been living on various ""high end"" dry cat foods for some time now (e.g., the ""Before Grain"" foods in chicken, tuna and salmon versions, and some fancy pantsy ""Duck a l'orange"" stuff from our local pet shop).  They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.",Neutral
"Hello!  We are Marissa and Lilith.  Mojosmom is our human.  She said we could write this review because we ate this and she didn't.  We like it!  We especially like the Chinese Chicken (mom said the package actually calls it ""Sesame Chicken"", but we can't read, so it doesn't matter).  The Pot Pie entr&eacute;e had an awful lot of broth and not a lot of meat.  But we licked the bowl clean anyway.  Mom says she likes this because it doesn't have a strong, icky smell like some canned cat food.  But she says that it would take a lot of these cans to feed it to us all the time (1-2 cans per 2.5 lbs of our weight - she said something about how Lilith could stand to lose a a pound or two or three), so we'll just get a couple of cans along with our dry food.  Maybe if we ignore the dry food she'll get the message, but she can be pretty stubborn!",Neutral
"I usually give my cats canned food as a treat, so I thought I would give this a try for them.<br /><br />Like the other reviews the ingredients list was nice, there were a few ingredients I wasn't sure about like carrageenan and menadione sodium bisulfite but they all turned out to be a mineral supplement or a thickening agent.<br /><br />I opened the chicken pot pie first. Very watery with pea sized chunks of chicken, tiny bits of carrots and what looks like onion in it. It smelled like cat food.<br /><br />The sesame chicken also smelled like cat food, mind you not like a horrible smell, but if you put that and the actual chicken pot pie or sesame chicken in front of me blindfolded I'd be able to tell which was which just from the smell, it's a cat food smell. Anyway, the sesame chicken had pea sized chicken bits in it along with carrots and rice and a hint of sesame oil aroma to it.<br /><br />Minion Number Two is my picky eater (no, that's a nickname). He liked the juice and ate a few bits of the meat then went to his regular cat food, even side by side he still didn't eat the treat.<br /><br />Minion Number One (also a nickname) will eat most natural foods from potatoes, hamburger to whole wheat bread. He too enjoyed the juice a lot, ate a few pieces of the chicken then wandered off. He never came back to finish it.<br /><br />It gets three stars. Two for the ingredients and one that my cats like the juice. It doesn't get five because one, the price, I can see why it's more (because of the ingredients) but my cats will finish off other cans of cat food that are only half the price which is point two, being two adult male cats with hearty appetites they didn't like it enough to finish it.",Neutral
"The chicken pot pie variety was extremely runny, interestingly that seemed to be the only part my cats ate, the licked up the broth.  But they literally nosed the potatoes and carrots right off their plates.  It was like watching picky toddlers.  I divided one can between three cats and I still had about a half a can left after they ate.  I also watched as they finished all three cats ran to the litter box. (apparently it comes out watery too)<br /><br />One of my cats - the little vixen whose part siamese then went and did a protest in my laundry hamper.<br /><br />So when they tried the seasame chicken I only gave it to the two critters who don't voice their displeasure so eloquently.  They still did not finish their meals, again the carrots hit the floor, and perhaps the most suprising, normally when I open a can of cat food they come a running, not so on either opening, and even though the company claims the food smells more appealing, I disagree, as did the cats.<br /><br />So it's 3 stars because at least they ate some of it, but I'm very sorry to say they didn't appear to like it.

"I purchaed the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> and the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCVY8I"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  My cat enjoyed this selection okay, but it seemed like he was much happier with the seafood sampler.  This picture on the box looks like something very similar to human food, but the actual contents weren't as close as I had hoped.  I try more and more to buy food that are more natural and less processed.  These claimed to be full of vitamins and 100 percent of the required nutrition.  That might be the case, but my cat sure didn't get all of his nutrition.  Where as he would drink all of the liquid from the seafood flavors, he didn't much care for the abundance of chicken flavored gravies.  The large amount of gravy and small veggies in the Chicken Pot Pie flavor were not to his liking.  He eventually ate pretty much all of it, but not right away - which for a large cat on a diet like my cat - is ultra rare at my house.  He actually begged for something to eat while he still had the rest of the Chicken Pot Pie in his bowl.<br /><br />This food makes some good claims about the quality and I agree the food does look better than anything you get from a local Superstore for 25 cents a can.  My cat is a 12 year old Tabby Manx with some minor health issues.  His well being is important enough that I will buy better made food instead of just cheap stuff... but when it starts going to waste... and at a higher cost to me?  I consider this to be a one time only purchase and do not plan to reorder even if it's on sale.  Nothing against this company, but I think they would do better with a variety pack of 6-8 flavors with only one chicken flavor for every 5 or so other flavors.  If my cat doesn't like it today, then imagine what it will be like in a week when he has had it 7 days in a row.  More than likely most of these cans will go to the dog just so they won't be completely wasted.<br /><br />If you also tried this pack and your cats turned up their noses to it, then I'd recommend the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack of seafood flavors instead if your cat is more of meat-eater than a vegetable / gravy eater.",Neutral
"I have three cats, one is 12 years old (Fred), one is 9 years old (Jewel) and a kitten that is 4 months old (Angel).  The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk; the other two will eat almost anything.<br /><br />I first served the 'Chicken Pot Pie' flavor to the cats.  Visually, the canned food looks very appealing to me.  The look and smell is very similar to chicken pot pie - real pieces of shredded white meat chicken in a savory sauce.  The food was not watery at all; more like the consistency of a store bought frozen chicken pot pie filling.<br /><br />The kitten refused to eat the Chicken Pot Pie.  Fred licked a tiny amount and ran away.  No amount of coaxing him could get him to return for another taste.  Jewel licked away at the juices but did not eat the meat, which is typical for her.  She later returned to nibble some more but did not seem overly satisfied.<br /><br />Overall, I would call the Chicken Pot Pie a failure as nearly 60% of it was left in the bowl.<br /><br />Next up was the Sesame Chicken.  Suspicious, I read the label and was surprised to find that there were no organ meats, no denatured meat byproducts and no wheat gluten.  It is not made in China.  It looked good and smelled pretty good too...<br /><br />Again, the kitten refused to touch it.  She is very particular about what she eats, so this is understandable.  This time, Fred ate about 1/3 of it and Jewel did not want anything to do with it.<br /><br />Although the ingredients, nutrition and place of origin are important, in the end, it all comes down to whether my cats will eat the food.  I was disappointed that my cats did not care for this food.<br /><br />I must say, however, that cats are very particular animals.  Even though my cats did not like it, your cats might devour it in an instant.  As for quality, I give this food high marks.  It looks edible and smells like real food.<br /><br />Bottom line - I would recommend purchasing a sample before you go out and get a whole box.",Neutral

"These catfoods come in smaller cans, which is great for one serving. Upon opening, they look delicious. However, not all cats like it. I tried one of each with my two, who love fish and seafood, and they sniffed and walked away.<br />A neighbor's cat and two friend's cats loved it. So, as we all know with cats... they can be finicky! I would have to say give it a try and see if yours like it. They really look great, smaller cans store easily also.",Neutral
"My kitty loves tuna and dry cat food.  I've never tried to give her soft food until this.  She didn't eat it until it was in her dish for most of the day when she had eaten her regular dry food.<br />It looks like it would be good.  It looks like pieces of fish, but for some reason this didn't excite her as much as tuna.<br />I'm getting a new kitty soon, and I'll update it when I try to give new kitty this food.<br />Edit: New kitty likes it fine.  This isn't her favorite choice.  She likes tuna, chicken, and beef all better than this.  Unlike the other cat, she likes this more than dry food - about as much as she likes the Iams wet food I also feed her.",Neutral
"My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.  Brownie prefers the dry food but will eat some canned food only when the can is freshly opened.  Pi likes both.  We tried the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) and the Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Chinese Chicken & Chicken Pot Pie) over the course of sixteen days. Each cat got about one-quarter can each day.  I alternated cans of chicken and fish varieties.<br /><br />At first, the felines were enthusiastic.  After a while they tired of the chicken.  Pi would only lick up the gravy, while Brownie refused to even look at it.  The fish was better received.  They like the yellowfin and the tuna & shrimp.  The cat vote is for two of the six varieties.<br /><br />There is, however, a question of mercury in ocean fish.  A 1995 study in Japan found that cats that ate tuna had a higher concentration of mercury in their fur than cats that ate dry cat food.  The study and its results are discussed in an article that you can find on the web by using the search term ""all about tuna fish"".  I posted a question on the Petite Cuisine web site as to whether they had tested their products for mercury.  I have not received an answer.  My conclusion is that it may be ok to give the cats fish as an occasional treat but not as a steady diet.",Neutral

"I had a whole case of this to try, so thought it would be fun to try it on as many cats as possible. Thus, by recruiting 5 friends, we ended up trying Petite Cuisine chicken cat food on 13 cats--7 males & 6 females; 4 inside cats, 5 outside & 4 inside/outside. Their ages ranged from 1 year to 16 years. Their weights ranged from 8 pounds to 16 pounds. Twelve of these cats eat Purina One Chicken & Rice dry cat food or Purina One Senior formula, which is a chicken formula. Four of those also eat other types of dry cat food. The sixteen year old cat eats Purina One Salmon & Tuna. Eight of the cats only eat canned tuna or seafood type canned food--namely Meow Mix's Market Select types with no chicken or wheat gluten. The other 5 eat seafood, chicken, turkey or beef canned foods.<br /><br />I was surprised at the results...only one cat, a one year old outside male, of questionable ownership, ate both the Chicken Pot Pie & Chinese Chicken every time he was offered it. Actually, he eats anything he is offered, and is very well fed. He loves meat, too. Another outside cat--a 2 year old male--ate the Chicken Pot Pie every time he was offered it, but would not eat the Chinese Chicken. A third male--a 16 pound inside/outside orange tabby--would consume all the juice of the Chicken Pot Pie, and would eat only some of the chicken. Most of the other cats would also consume the broth of the Chicken Pot Pie, but would not touch the meat. The Chicken Pot Pie has lots of broth, which I think is brilliant, since all the cats I know always like the broth of canned cat food or tuna best.<br /><br />I don't know why this canned cat food was not better liked. It has great ingredients and smells like human food. I hope to try Petite Cuisine seafood catfood one day...I think they all might like that much better.",Neutral
"The cans are tiny, and filled mostly with water, so be very, very careful upon opening.  The force needed to bend the lid up is just enough to send the ""chicken pot pie"" concoction spraying onto everything in vicinity, leaving a puddle with some carrots in it for your cat.<br />My cat doesn't much care for the carrots.  Or for the lumps of wheat glutenish chickenfood, 3-5 per can.  This is more of a soup course, or an after-supper tea.  Seriously, this barely passes for food, and in no way requires so much packaging.<br /><br />The sesame chicken, however, has earned a spot on my cat's, and on all of his outdoor pal's, favorites list.  The sauce is just viscous enough for genteel lapping, and the julienned meat a considerable presence.  Plus: no carrots.  This cat food's presentation qualities place it right up in my own top three: if you ever indulge the pre-dawn-feeding cry, you may grow to love this stuff too.  Feeding can be done half-asleep and one-handed: give the can a shake, pop the top off, and upend it into a tiny cat bowl.That's it. The interior walls of the can are very smooth -- they may be plastic coated, so check your recycling outfit's guidelines and then discount my next point -- so smooth that the gooey stuff pours right out. No rinsing needed. The odor is quite inoffensive.  But if your cat begs to eat it outside, watch out: if the neighborcats smell it, there's gonna be a rumble.<br /><br />At $4/pack retail, or $1 for three weensy ounces of liquid-plus-some-bits, I canot recommend the signture chicken pot pie.  If the brand ever markets the sesame chicken solo, however, and promotional discounts are offered, I'd definitely stock up.",Neutral
"This review covers the two chicken flavors offered here as well as four fish flavors in the variety pack offered elsewhere on this site.  My three cats loved all four fish flavors and the Chicken Pot Pie but only the one who eats anything would eat the Sesame Chicken. Fortunately Chicken Pot Pie is available separately.<br /><br />Because of concerns about the controversial ingredient menadione sodium bisulfite raised in Joe McBu's review of the fish flavors, I'm  somewhat wary of  this product.  A Google check of ""menadione sodium sulfite in pet food"" shows  there's quite a bit of concern in the blogosphere  and it centers on two factors 1. This ingredient is a cheap and not very effective source of Vitamin K that has not been tested for safety in pets.  2. The FDA  bans it for human consumption due to its associations with kidney/liver damage.  So the question then becomes: might it not also be a factor in why kidney disease is such a common pet killer, especially senior pets (which mine are)?  Consumer concerns seem to be having some impact, as many manufacturers are discontinuing using it. An email questioning its use sent to the Petite Cuisine site over a week ago has not been answered.<br /><br />After losing  a cat to the poisoned Chinese wheat gluten in '07, I switched to Fancy Feast grilled flavors,  the only wet food that was both free from wheat gluten and considered edible by my fussiest cat when laced with his evening meds.  Petite Cuisine is a huge hit with Fitz, probably because it's  even more liquidy than grilled Fancy Feast, which I've just learned also contains menadione.<br /><br />So, what to do?  At the moment I'm dividing one can of Petite Cuisine among the three cats for the evening meal when Fitz gets his meds, supplemented with California Natural or Paul Newman Senior dry food, neither of which contain menadione. Mornings I use wet Wellness (which is much less popular at my house, but menadione-free) instead of Petite Cuisine or Fancy Feast.  For treats, Greenies have been eliminated in favor of  Whole Life Chicken Treats.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I recommend you read Joe McBu's review on the fish pack page.",Neutral
"Our cats usually get the ""green can"" Fancy Feast shredded varieties (they aren't interested in the green can souffle types, and the Florentine varieties give them gastric problems).  The green can stuff is more elegant cat food, not amorphous brown blobs.  Petite Cuisine cat food, while something they dove into, was much more watery than the meat-packed Fancy Feasts, and they have been suffering from loose bowels ever since we started them on the test cans.  We're going to do one can every three days to see if they can handle that, with the green can stuff on the other two days.  I'll report back.",Neutral
"I know, I should have read the whole description before ordering these, but I thought they were the ""bite size"" cookies, and instead they are VERY MINI cookies, like smaller than MnM's.  It makes them a little hard to eat, and they are a huge mess for kids, but they taste good!",Neutral
"I loved half of these flavors, liked one, and dumped the one down the drain. I'm glad I ordered this six pack though so I didn't make the mistake of buying a three-pack of one of the flavors I didn't like. Here's what I thought of them:<br /><br />Vanilla - EXCELLENT! I've used this syrup in ice cream, coffee, diet cola, and even in a low-carb crepe recipe. It's really good and one that I will re-order on it's own.<br /><br />Hazelnut - Yummy, rich flavor. It's great in coffee. I would order this again.<br /><br />Raspberry - I loved this one also. It's great in coffee and berry smoothies.<br /><br />Chocolate - I liked this one but it is VERY STRONG. Literally, one drop in a glass of diet cola will make it into a chocolate coke. It's good, but you don't need much. It didn't work well in coffee.<br /><br />Irish Creme - I knew I wouldn't like this one so it remains unopened. I made a mistake of buying a three pack of this one once and hated it. I'll give it away to someone who will enjoy it.<br /><br />CLASSIC Caramel - I don't know why Torani insists on making ""Sugar Free Caramel Syrup"" and ""Sugar Free CLASSIC Caramel Syrup"". The Classic Caramel is terrible. After experimenting and trying to find a use for this syrup I just dumped it down the drain. It's not worth it. Avoid this one.",Neutral
"My local grocery store only carries the vanilla Torani syrup in the sugar-free version, and so I decided to order the variety pack from Amazon to see what I thought of their other flavors.  I try to limit my sugar intake, so that's why I was so keen to get a variety of sugar-free ones.  Interestingly, I found that the different flavors do better in different types of drinks.<br /><br />Vanilla - This is still hands down one of the most versatile flavors. I add it to carbonated water and make my own creme soda. It also does well in hot chocolate and coffee, and I've also added it to baking recipes when I've been in a pinch and out of vanilla extract.<br /><br />Raspberry - I'm not usually a huge fan of artificial raspberry flavors, and I don't like this one in coffee or hot chocolate, but it is absolutely wonderful in iced tea! Who knew? I was prepared to donate this one to the office coffee stash, but on a whim added it to my iced tea when I was out of Splenda, and wow, it's very good and seems to lose the funky aftertaste in the tea.<br /><br />Caramel - I'm not overly impressed with this one, but it does work well in adding to my oatmeal in the morning to liven up the plain oats. It tastes even better with a dash of cinnamon, but I don't use this one in drinks because it just tastes kind of odd. It's almost like they couldn't decide between caramel, butterscotch and some other random flavor and kind of went with the middle ground.  I wouldn't order this flavor by itself.<br /><br />Chocolate - This is another one that I've added to my oatmeal at breakfast and have been happy with the result.  This one also works with coffee, but not tea.<br /><br />Irish Creme - I'm a big Irish Creme fan usually, but this one is just kind of so-so.  I do like it in a glass of hot milk for a steamer, and it's okay in hot chocolate, but tastes weird in coffee.<br /><br />Hazelnut - This is a good one for coffee, hot chocolate and oatmeal.  I combine it with the Chocolate one in the oatmeal and it tastes kind of like a Ferrero Rocher, and makes my daily breakfast feel like a bit more of an indulgence than it really is.<br /><br />I ordered the Variety Pack on the Subscribe and Save 4 month rotation, and had to go in and cancel the second shipment because I'm only about halfway through the bottles. It's a toss up as to whether or not I'll completely cancel the subscription because these are sugar-free and it's so hard to find flavor additions that don't come laden down with teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Amazon - it would be wonderful if you could offer a make your own variety pack of the Sugar-free syrups! I've seen other Torani sugar-free choices, but I don't want to make the commitment to a 6 pack of a single flavor. I'd definitely order a lot more of these syrups if I could mix up the Variety pack to be more than just these 6 flavors.",Neutral
"The Torani chocolate & raspberry sugar-free syrups were to die for!  :)  The caramel was pretty bad, I thought.  The others were good but I wouldn't order them again.  I think this is personal preference stuff.",Neutral
"The vanilla, chocolate and irish cream are yummy. The others . . . not so much. But it does make a nice addition to my ever-growing wet bar. they are sweet, so go easy with them.  I find all it takes is about 1-1.5 cap fulls to flavor the drink. anything more than that and you get that artificial sweetener taste.  Also, for those that care, the irish cream, chocolate, hazelnut and raspberry are gluten free.",Neutral
"Bought to supplement taste on food plan but selection was not disclosed and took a gamble.  Good selection for coffee, not for my uses.  Product is great.",Neutral
"I can be a little timid when it comes to trying sugar-free products. Many leave that horrible aftertaste or at the least take some serious getting used to. But I gave these a shot because I'm not willing to consume 4 cups of coffee a day with each having an extra 70 kcal shot of the regular syrup. That's an extra 280 calories at the start of my day! But these were positively delicious with no bad taste or guilt from empty calories.<br /><br />So I gave the variety pack a go, knowing I was sure to find a quick favorite.<br /><br />My favorite was the Vanilla. Sweet and earthy just like vanilla should be. I will definitely be buying this one again.<br /><br />The Irish Cream was my second favorite out of the six. It adds an amazing creamy, buttery finish to each sip of coffee that you are sure to die for.<br /><br />In third, was the Chocolate syrup. I am generally not a mocha fan so I used the chocolate syrup a bit sparingly at first. But soon I was splashing in even more. It has a very gentle dark chocolate flavor without the bitter notes usually associated with dark variety.<br /><br />Next was the hazelnut. I am neither impressed nor detested by this flavor. It is a bit mediocre when compared to the more full-bodied syrups but will do in a pinch if you're craving that touch of sweetness.<br /><br />Second to last we have the Classic Caramel. This was absolutely disappointing. I hoped for hints of cream and brown sugar, but instead got a simple sweet syrup with hardly any actual flavor. It did the job of sweetening my coffee but did not provide the caramel heaven I desired. I have heard the Salted Caramel is much better, so that flavor has been added to my ""To-Try List"".<br /><br />Last is the raspberry, my least favorite. I am detested by the idea of fruity coffee (ei. blueberry, raspberry, etc.) so this was not a good coffee syrup for me. Instead, I decided to make raspberry tea with it. After several tries with black, green, and cranberry-pomegranate tea, I have decided this syrup just doesn't work well. As most of the syrups are made to add a subtle flavor to robust coffee, you have to add much more syrup if you want to actually flavor your tea. And all of that extra syrup just makes it way to sweet. This was also the only flavor I actually tasted that sugar-free aftertaste, though possibly because I had to use so much.<br /><br />It's hard to give a good rating for a variety pack as there are three spectacular flavors and three slightly disappointing flavors.<br /><br />Overall though I say this sampler is great if you're new to their syrups and would like to try a good variety of their flavors for a great price. But if you already have established your favorites, I'd suggest buying their 3 pack of a single flavor at the same retail-reduced price of under $5 a bottle.",Neutral
"I've tried only the caramel, chocolate and hazelnut flavours so far and am disappointed. This is the first and last time that I will buy a sugar=free syrup. I don't usually do sugar-free but I was recently on a diet so I gave in. In any case, I've had regular Torani syrups in the past, and they never failed to please. The sugar-free chocolate was gross. Did not taste like chocolate at all. The caramel smelled very hopeful, but ultimately tasted awful as well. The only one so far that actually tastes like its indicated flavour is the hazelnut. For the time being, I am back to my regular Torani syrups, but perhaps one day soon, I'll brave another sugar-free one...",Neutral
This is a great amount for the money.  I didn't like the taste of sugar free though.  I'll be ordering the regular kind.,Neutral
"Love the six-pack .... but not all the flavors.<br />Would love to be able to pick the ones I wanted.<br />Why not give us a choice of all the available flavors?<br />My favorites are the caramel, hazelnut, and vanilla.<br />I wouldn't mind getting two of each of those on the next order.<br />Is this possible?",Neutral
"Amazon doesn't list the ingredients of this, but it does contain lots of high fructose corn syrup and regular corn syrup.  Corn syrup, especially the high fructose variety, is quite bad for you.  It's cheap for manufacturers, that's partly why they use it.  I'm disappointed in Heinz about his.  Due to this, it has 4 grams of sugar per 1 Tbsp serving, double the sugar of another bottle of regular ketchup I have.  Since most of us use at least 2 Tbsp per serving this is quite a bit of sugar.<br /><br />Second, this uses Potassium Chloride, the main ingredient of No Salt salt substitute.  This can be fine for many people (used in moderation) but it is a strict no-no for people taking certain blood pressure medications, such as myself (I think many medications in the ACE-inhibitor family especially).<br /><br />I should have somehow found the ingredients list from Heinz itself (or somewhere on the net) before buying this.  Maybe I tried, I forget.  At any rate, for your convenience, here is the list of ingredients, in this exact order from the label:<br />""INGREDIENTS: TOMATOE CONCENTRATE MADE FROM RED RIPE TOMATOES, DISTILLED VINEGAR, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, *POTASSIUM CHLORIDE, SPICE, ONION POWDER, GARLIC POWDER, NATURAL FLAVORING.  * NOT IN REGULAR KETCHUP""<br /><br />Interestingly, this did not come in a case, even though 9 is the minumum order.  It came as loose bottles in a box.  Also, there was a barcode/description label sticker over part of the manufacturer ingredients list and nutrition info label in the exact same place on each bottle.  This was probably for internal Amazon purposes.  I bit of a pain to peel back to read underneath, but you only really need to do this on one bottle anyway, so not that big of a deal.<br /><br />I hope this review is helpful.",Neutral

It is hard for me to assign stars to the cat litter.  I like the product and so do my cats. From that standpoint it is 5 stars.

"My husband and I are big fans of Lavazza's Super Crema coffee, but got a bag of the Tierra blend recently while the Super Crema was out of stock. While the smell and color are wonderful, we found the Tierra 100% arabica blend to be much more bitter than our regular blend, and even after we added cream or milk to our coffee we felt unable to continue to drink it, so we gave it away after only a few brews (we are straight espresso drinkers otherwise). We have now received our regular Super Crema again and couldn't be happier.",Neutral
"Despite this being 100% Arabica it had a sharpness to the flavor that I'm more used to finding in blends including Robusta. There's nothing wrong with the quality, and I applaud Lavazza for introducing a Fair Trade coffee, but it just wasn't to my taste I'm afraid.",Neutral
"I just got these beans and have pulled a couple dozen shots, trying out different permutations of amount, grind, tamp.<br /><br />I'm disappointed as I expected a better flavor from the beans.<br /><br />The beans have a strong midrange coffee flavor and a strong sharp lemon note. The midrange coffee flavor is uncomplicated but good. A little chocolaty perhaps The lemon note is unpleasant for my taste which makes the beans go from a four star to a three star.<br /><br />When you pull a good espresso shot it tastes smooth for about 10 seconds, then the lemony taste creeps in and makes it unpleasant.<br /><br />The lemony taste is good in milk drinks however, it provides some character and interesting flavor. The strong coffee flavor also stands up to the milk and gives it a good flavor. I like lattes with these beans.<br /><br />The overall verdict is meh. If you only want milk drinks then these beans might suit you. If you like shots, I'd advise you to look elsewhere.",Neutral
"I have bought this 2 other times and really enjoyed it... so much so I subscribed.  However, this time I don't think the bag they sent was a recent roast because it was very flat and the crema was poor compared to the previous batches.

They are definitely having issues with quality control if batches can taste so differently from each other.",Neutral
"I was excited to buy a larger bag of organic Lavazza beans at a good price. While not a coffee / espresso snob, I do like coffee and have lived and imbibed in enough coffee-centric countries to have some points of comparison.

I bought it to use in a stove top espresso maker - not a pulled shot - where it did well as the base for a nice cappuccino or latte...but not exceptional. As an Americano or in a Bodum, it didn't work for me. Just strong, a little bitter...someone here mentions a lemon overtone and while I don't normally go for the descriptive terms, I think the lemon overtone is a problem for me too. It's a strong coffee, a little bitter, not smooth, lemon acidic overtone, verging on dark roast, not too oily...serviceable, but not in anyway distinctive in its flavors. So I am moving on.",Neutral
Lavazza is definitely a great value.  Superior quality and taste for the price.  Illy rules but you pay for it.  This one has a bit of sourness compared to the others but I don't mind much.,Neutral
"I had the Lavazza Super Crema and loved it but I wanted to give this a try for my espresso.  I really like the Super Cremas flavor, it was nutty, fruity, and a bit of chocolate.  This just tastes like any coffee you get at any gas station to me, at least when making espresso.  Its not bad, but to me its just ordinary. I guess purists may like it, I dunno, when it comes to coffee I may not be as sophisticated as some.  Kinda like wine, I like it sweet and red, not so dry.  I don't want my coffee to taste like coffee, I want it to be a treat.",Neutral
"Good coffee but a medium roast. If you dwell in the Northwest US, or prefer dark roast ala Starbucks,this is not likely going to satisfy you.",Neutral
Lavazza is a top name in coffee but I found this to be nothing special and not creating a large amount of crema when brewed in an esspresso machine,Neutral

This is the only set of hot cocoas that had a sticker of Raggedy Andy wrapped around the tin insted of it being imprinted on the actual tin.

"I love these biscuits with tea in the morning and haven't been able to find them anywhere locally. I was delighted to find them available at Amazon and after reading a few reviews that sounded as if the packing problems had been taken care of, I ordered a box of 6 packages. The biscuits are great, the packing...not so much. All six packs were stuffed into a small plastic bag which was crammed into a bubble bag which was wrapped in bubble wrap and placed into a box with air pacs stuffed around it. Four packs are mostly crumbs, the other two had a lot of breakage on the ends. I think they might have been ok if they hadn't forced them into the too-small bag and bubble bag in their zeal to over-protect. Maybe carefully wrapping each pac individually in bubblewrap and placing them in the center of a box of air pacs would get them delivered in one piece, but I doubt that will happen so will not bother to order them from Amazon again...",Neutral
McVities digestive biscuits are great - not nearly as sweet as competitors. Biggest problem is how many are broken by the time they get to you. The Amazon packaging job does not hold up in shipping. This is true for all types of digestives I have received over the last couple of years from Amazon. Unfortunately they are the best source in the US. I wish they could think up a better packaging scenario for fragile items like this.,Neutral
"The biscuit is reasonably good, better than most made in US biscuits. However, Amazon's packaging is horrendous. Most of the biscuit came crushed in their individual packs.",Neutral

"I will continue to give these to my dogs. They like them and supposedly they clean their teeth.<br />I started to give these to my dog daily, but her digestive system did not like it enough for that. Most of it seems to be digestible, but she threw up green foam on the morning after the second day in a row of eating one-a-day greenies. Note that she was also constipated as well. Greenie advises to have plenty of water available for drinking these, so I am guess they know these side effects can occur. My dog has plenty of water available, but she didn't drink any more than normal, which may have resulted in the effects. I don't plan on training my dog to drink lots of extra water after eating these. Giving here one every now and then shows no negative effects, and that what I plan on doing.<br />Not a complaint to me, but I think people who like giving there dog all natural health food should know that this product is far from ""green."" It is pumped pull of artificial ingredients like a multivitamin. It is also made from concentrated grain protein, rather than the animal protein dogs should be getting. I personally don't feel that this is that big of a deal health wise for a creature than lives 12-18 years, but or people who invest the extra money on organic/natural dog food, you should be staying away from this product.",Neutral

"Updates: One Day, One Week, Two Weeks, One Month, Three Months, Six Months<br /><br />One Day<br />-------<br />Ordered these yesterday and they came in today, even with Prime two-day shipping - Thanks Amazon!  I gave one to my dachshund, a short-haired 25-lb ball of energy, and he loved it.  He's 10 years old and had typical dog breath.  I'm hoping that giving these to him will not only make his breath less stinky, but also (and more importantly) help out with his teeth.  Whenever he yawns or opens his mouth wide, I can see some plaque on his rear teeth.  The vet hasn't said anything bad about that when I've brought it up, but he no longer rips on his rope toys like he used to.  Sure, some of his loss of love for tug of war can be attributed to age, but I think maybe his teeth are a bit weaker too.  I'll update this according to the schedule I laid out at the very top and let you know what happens.  I've also seen lots of reviews online (not about this product, but about dog- and pet-food in general) being made out of sub par or even unhealthy materials.  I'll let you know if my dog's behavior or overall health changes as well.<br /><br />One Week<br />-------<br />My dog is still loving these things.  I feed him in the morning so I like to think these are an evening snack for him.  I don't know what exactly the dental chews are made from, but I'm able to bend the little green toothbrush-shaped chews into a ""U"" and they don't seem to break.  Perhaps it's some kind of gel or gummy chew?  His breath seems a little less ""heavy"".  His teeth seem to be the same. His behavior hasn't changed either, other than being extremely excited to get a chew at night.  This last bit is important to me, because I know some dog treats can be more like dog-crack!<br />See you in a week!<br /><br />Eventually<br />--------<br />Sorry I didn't keep up to my schedule - I think these things work, though not as well as I'd hoped.  My dog still has lots of plaque and buildup on his rear teeth and more disturbingly these things have caused my dog to frequently urinate in my house.  I suspect they are making him drink a lot of water which he can't hold in.  I walk him three times a day and put him outside two to three more times so there's no issue on my end.<br />My ultimate conclusion is that these are just OK.  They aren't damaging to my dog's health... but to say they were helpful in improving his dental situation would be giving these too much credit.<br />My S&S shipments have been cancelled and I'm out looking for a better product.",Neutral
"I have three dogs.  They all loved the Greenies.  One dog does not chew her food, but gulps it whole.  I had to cut the Greenies into smaller portions for her.  It does help clean teeth, but caused diarrhea.  I think I'll look for another product for teeth cleaning.",Neutral

I realize that the picture shows the Teenie size w/96 and 27oz, so naturally the next size up Petite would have fewer bones, but I think receiving only 45 is a bit deceiving.  45 bones for almost $25 isn't bad, but I won't be purchasing on a regular basis.  These are for a Christmas gift, so they are a splurge anyway!  My dogs, a Chihuahua, MinPin and Shichon love them!",Neutral
"When we opened the box, we found it to be full of small worms. My husband was able to remove them with a small brush but they shouldn't have been there in the first place. We have gone through many many boxes of greenies and this is the first time we found worms in them. The dogs love the greenies and it helps their teeth a lot.",Neutral
"From a taste perspective, your dog will probably love this product; however, I do not recommend that you buy it for your dog.  As with any dental treat, the purpose is for the dog to chew it and work the toothpaste that is in the treat around the teeth to get them nice and clean.  The problem with this treat is that dogs will literally eat them in three bites, which means that the treat is not working on the teeth.  Also, because the dog eats them in three bites, this product is much more likely to put your dog at risk of choking on them.  This product is very expensive and, from my opinion, I just don't recommend them.",Neutral

"The price on this product was quite good.  I was aware before I bought it that it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, which I avoid like the plague because it increases one's triglycerides.  But then so does honey.

My first shock is the size of the jars.  4.5 oz ain't much - think baby food.  The other thing I didn't like is that nowhere on any of the jars could I find an expiration date!!  Looks like Amazon took individual jars not labeled for resale from a large box.  Maybe it is OK to sell stuff in Italy without a date, but I am sure some law is being violated selling it here in the US.  Anyways, I opened a jar and it tastes OK, so I'm keeping it this time, but have doubts about re-ordering in the future.<br /><br />My recommendation for Amazon: if you want to get into the online food-selling business, please make sure that not only the products are labeled properly, but the expiration date is noted on the product page.",Neutral

"I bought this for my 4 month old Frenchie and he just seems absolutely disinterested in it lol. The way the bottle is shaped along with the rope it's almost ""by accident"" that the treats come out. He plays with it for about 5 minutes but then goes back to his IQ TREAT BALL that I also bought on Amazon. I feel like you have to basically flip this bottle upside down and mess with the rope for it to come out and I don't see Jackson being able to do that. If the bottle is laying flat as in the picture, how does the treat come up the neck and out the hole? He does grab the rope and run around with the bottle but I can tell this is not his most favorite toy.",Neutral
"This toy has a failing if you have a dog who's too clever for it's own good. The rope is a weak point. I understand the theory that the dog is supposed to use the rope to chuck the bottle around and have the food come out, but after a couple of days our collie picked the toy up, took it across to her bed, and started determinedly chewing through the rope.<br /><br />The manufacturer recommends you put the plastic practice golf balls in the jug instead of the rope, and this worked for a while, but then our dog started chewing the purple ball off the end of the bottle, and when she'd got sufficiently through that, managed to crack the neck of the bottle itself.<br /><br />We got her a replacement (as it took some weeks for her to crack the first bottle) and this time the rope lasted less than two days. So, it's back to the plastic golf balls, and hopefully it will take her some while to get to the stage of cracking the bottle again, but I suspect it's only a question of time.<br /><br />The manufacturers, IMO, need to implement two improvements.<br /><br />1) The rope needs to be impregnated with something which tastes unpleasant.<br /><br />2) The spikes on the rubber ball need to be made longer and firmer to try to protect the neck of the bottle.<br /><br />Those reservations aside, our dog loves the toy, but then she has a very high food drive, probably due to her months as a stray.",Neutral

We continued to use the toy cracked, until the lid finally cracked and was no longer able to be screwed on.  All said, the toy lasted about two months.  You decide if the price is worth it.

My dog doesn't play with the latter 2, but LOVES the twist and treat! It's easy to twist the top off and insert the treats and to twist it down to the size you want to get it to dispense. Smoothie quickly learned how to dispense the treats, so we have it on its tightest setting (puppy chow is pretty small, so easy to get out). He chases and bats this all over the living room.<br /><br />He played with the classic Kong once, but because it dispenses the treats so quickly, he soon lost interest and went back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />He tries to play with the Tug a Jug, but he can never get anything out and quickly tires of it and goes back to the twist and treat.<br /><br />Of the 3, the twist and treat gets the most use, its the easiest to clean, is hardy, has the best movement for him to chase around, & is the perfect size for a toy dog.<br /><br />So, if you're looking to keep your dog entertained, don't waste money buying a bunch of products, just get the twist and treat. Both you and your pup will be pleased with it.<br /><br />21 March 2012 Update<br /><br />I have since removed the back end of the jug and my dog will now play with it, in fact he expects for me to put all his food in it so he can chase it around and dig them out with his paws and nose. That said, this is the only way for him to use the jug, so still not fulfilling its intended purpose or use. Cleaning if course is a pain.",Neutral
"I have a 10 month old golden retriever and this product, while I liked the bottom opening for easy loading of food/treats (some toys dont even have that), the rope is not very long lasting for a heavy chewer. It only lasted &lt; 24 hours before the strands got unraveled and i had to cut it off. Now i'm just using the bottle itself as a food/treat dispenser, which is just like a Kong Wobbler. My dog, after just 2 days with it, has already figured out how to get the food out as quickly as possible - by grabbing the bottom of the bottom with his mouth and lifting it upside down. Putting large treats or pingpong balls inside will help make it more challenging.",Neutral
"I thought this was a great toy, but my shepherd mix (supposedly very smart according to several different trainers we've worked with) never really got into it.<br /><br />He likes tug toys, but this is not a great tug toy because the dog will grab the rope end, and you'll grab the plastic jug end. If your dog is any good at playing tug at all, you will lose every time.<br /><br />He did not seem to enjoy chewing the purple spiky part either.<br /><br />There was some interest in getting the treats out, but it never lasted very long. The treats have to be fairly small to come out. I spent nearly an hour cutting up treats to make them easy to get out, and that helped perk his interest a little, but he always went back to other toys.<br /><br />Maybe its too complex for him. He does LOVE another puzzle toy we have. Its like a buster cube, but its a tough rubber ball (melon sized) with a maze like center. You put treats in one side by pushing them through a crossed slit, and after some rolling they fall out a hole on the other side. He loves that toy. I think its cool, too, but I fear what might be growing inside it, and the only way I've figured out to clean it is to soak it in vinegar and then put it in the dishwasher and hope.<br /><br />This toy is at least easy to clean.<br /><br />I ended up giving it to a neighbor to see if her dog might like it better.",Neutral
"I bought two of these in med/lg along with Smarter Pets IQ Treat ball.  My well mannered collie mix needed company while I ran errands so we adopted a brother for him.  And this husky mix brother needed something ELSE to keep him from destroying my house (they aren't crated.... we tried with the husky but he escaped out of several different crates).  These toys, along with a peanut butter filled kong, are magnificent at distracting them while I'm away.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug is my least favorite.  It is difficult to fill-- filling is easy enough but kibble tends to dribble out as you TRY AND TRY AND TRY to match the threads and close the toy back up.  I can't emphasize how frustrating it is to close up this toy!!!<br /><br />My dogs, while very rough with each other, are not rough on toys inside.  They tend to be mellow.  This toy seems to require a dog who is eager to thrash and bash the toy.  I think my dogs might be more inclined to shake it had I bought the small size.  The med/lg is VERY big.  My dogs are BIG.  Not st. bernard big-- but my husky mix is my tallest dog at 60lbs (frame size is that of my old 95lb malamute, he's just a year old and hasn't filled out yet!) and my golden collie mix is 75 lbs and on the large side for a golden retriever.  Also, it holds LOTS of food.  Since the kibble in the toy is a supplement to their meals I only put a half a cup in it.  I haven't measured how much it holds but it must hold upwards of 3 or 4 cups.  When it is filled less the dog must work MUCH harder to get the kibble out.  I only use this toy when I plan to be away from home for more than 3hrs.<br /><br />They DO manage to empty them by carrying them upside down-- and really only the husky has a large enough mouth to manage this.  They kick some out of it as they would their treat-ball.  It takes them forever which suits my purpose of distracting them from my absence.<br /><br />All in all, it is well constructed.  My dogs would never be able to open this.  If your dog likes to shake his toys like a wolf and his prey this toy might be a wonderful choice.  If your dogs save rough play for outdoors and you plan to provide this as an indoor diversion you MIGHT want to look elsewhere.  And keep in mind the large scale this toy is made on!!",Neutral
"My 60-lb 13-month-old Labrador LOVED this toy but she cracked the top, effectively ruining it, within a few days. I'm not sure what size we had but I'm thinking it must have been the middle size (small?) - it was a good size for her insofar as she was able to fit the whole thing in her and tilt it on its side to let treats out but that's also how she cracked it. I'm going to get the biggest size, which I think will be able to withstand her, but I'm also predicting that she won't like it as much if she can't fit it in her mouth. Too bad they don't make this same toy with a rubber coating.",Neutral
"Try putting a tennis ball inside the bottle. My Border collie chewed the rope out too- to make it more challenging then just knocking it over and treats spilling out really easy, I put a smaller sized tennis ball inside so she still has to work the bottle back and forth in order to get the treats to go from the back of the bottle to the neck. Hope this helps! -Ali & *Kylie *the border collie/flat coat retriever mix",Neutral
"I got the Premier line of toys thinking I could varriate what they got each time I leave for work, on Monday it would be the twinst n treat, Tuesday the Tug a Jug, etc. But when I put this one down on the floor my two mutts just sat there and looked at me. I tried to show them that pulling the rope would cause the treats to come out but alas they just werent understanding. It has been almost twoo weeks now and still not much results. They love the other Premier toys, just arent quite smart enough for this one.",Neutral
"I thought the large would be too big for my Corgi's, but they seem to manage with it just fine. I did not notice that it comes in different sizes. My dog figured out how to get the treats out pretty quickly though. I also have the StarMark bob-a-lot and that seems to take them a little longer to get at the treats. You can adjust the hole sizes on the bob-a-lot.",Neutral
"I purchased this toy based on the recommendation from Dr. Ian Dunbar in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1577314557"">Before and After Getting Your Puppy: The Positive Approach to Raising a Happy, Healthy, and Well-Behaved Dog</a> and it was fantastic for about two weeks.<br /><br />The toy was banged up against the wall and table a few times in the normal course of play and the plastic screw-top shattered.<br /><br />My border collie puppy still will play with it now even though it's missing pieces and doesn't hold food anymore. This is great, but it's pretty much become an expensive rope toy.<br /><br />I wish I had known before purchasing that it was so delicate. A much sturdier food dispensing toy has been the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLTOKK"">Kibble Nibble Original, 7"" tall x 6"" dia</a> which has rubber bumpers that prevent the same shattering that happened to the tug-a-jug.",Neutral
It's kind of noisy so my dog doesn't love it. It's kind of an awkward design. There are better treat toys out there - my dog loves the disc shaped one.,Neutral
"I have a one year old lab mix that we adopted from a shelter. Got him as a puppy. I got this toy because I work out of the house, and he is constantly wanting me to play with him. Thought this would be ideal. Have no idea whether this is a good toy or not because my dog is afraid of it. He does not like anything that makes noise!! So, in theory it is a great toy, in practice, in my house, it's a bust!",Neutral
This toy is not so good if the treats or kibble is too big.....  even small kibbles have a hard time getting out of the jug.  I think this toy needs to be re-designed----My dog kept trying to pick up the jug from it's base so he can tip it up side down but the jug was too big to be picked up and made of slippery plastic (he's a Newfoundland with a big mouth).  He learned how to dump the food out with empty soda bottles that I would put kibble in.  It took a long time for him to get his food out and then at the end when there was only a little left he didn't want to play anymore because they would not come out.  I think I will either take the rope out or drill a small hole at the tid of the jug to make it more fun.,Neutral
"We bought this for our dog as a way to feed him his kibble and entertain him for about 20 minutes a day at the same time. Out of the box, it took him about 10 minutes to figure it out and empty it of the 1 1/2 cups of small kibble. If we fed larger kibble, it might take longer. But because I had read other reviews, I knew this to be the case and followed the advice of others on here. I added some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CSAJ96"">small tennis balls</a> to the jug and then threw the kibble in on top of it. That helped in 2 ways. First, the kibble didn't spill out of the neck while I was filling it from the bottom. Second, it slowed down the amount of time it took our dog to empty it (about half an hour).<br /><br />Just a word of warning: you will have kibble all over your floor until the dog goes back to eat it up. Ours is pretty good about going back to clean up after himself but you have to have patience that he will do that.",Neutral
"I Initially liked it but when left alone with my dog, her chewed thru the rope and plunger rendereing it useless. Lasted less then a week with my destroyer of a dog.",Neutral
"This toy is great for keeping a dog entertained, but not very sturdy. Granted I have 2 huskies who can destroy anything anyways, but...I have tried the KONG brand and never had a problem. Other toys as well. This one didn't last 30 minutes in their presence though.<br /><br />It is a good idea for smaller dogs.",Neutral
"I was quit suprised how big this tug-a-war toy was when I opened it.  My two pit bulls love it.  Unfortunetly, I read the precautions that stated not good if dogs shake and throw it around, after already purchasing it.  That's what one of my dog loves to do...so I try to give it to her while in her dog crate.",Neutral
Dog enjoyed playing with toy but the plastic bottle broke fairly quickly from being smacked around. Engaging but not durable.,Neutral
"I got this toy for my Border Collies and they had one really good play session with it before they tore it up.  The bottle itself survived, but the rest of it was ruined, so you couldn't use it as a treat dispenser which was the point.  I was hoping it would keep them busy/entertained. I think it would be okay for dogs that aren't as aggressive though.  My dogs can tear up pretty much anything though! lol",Neutral
"This is a great toy that my dog loved, but it didn't last very long. She likes to whip her toys around, and knocked this on something, and the container cracked. Also, the new style of toy has a nylon ""flossy"" style rope that is difficult to clean--man, that thing got smelly fast from kibble & doggy drool!<br /><br />Overall, great concept, but I wouldn't recommend if your dog is rough with their toys...",Neutral
The shipping was very fast. The product is super durable. It did not hold my dogs interest for to long. I am going to try a better treat and see if that works a little better. I say give it a try as long as its on sale.,Neutral
"I was initially surprised how big the toy was (small), but my dog (12 lb Terrier mix) ended up loving it anyways.  I feed him his meals between various puzzle toys and it does wonders for his destructive tendencies.  I was upset when it broke after only one week.  I have mostly carpet with minimal tile floor, so not sure if he got rough with it on the hard surfaces.  I tried taping the bottom shut after I fill it with food, but eventually the screw part totally fell apart and I had to throw it away.  Not sure I will buy another one at this price.  :(",Neutral
"This is definitely more challenging than a tricky treat ball or a twist n treat saucer, and our 55 lb pit mix really enjoys it.  However, it should not be used on hard floors.  After only 3 weeks the entire top is completely cracked, and it's only a matter of time until the entire thing is going to be broken.  Upon discovery of the cracks we started letting our dog play with this on the carpet, but it was too late; the damage was done.  We considered duct-taping the top to keep it in place and all in one piece, but it was too difficult to try to get the kibble in to the little space on the rope end.  We will probably buy another one of these since it is so much for for our dog, but I wish that it was more durable so that he could play with it in the kitchen on the tile floor.  Allowing him to play with it on carpet = lots of vacuuming of the kibble crumbs!",Neutral
"Our dog likes this toy which we had gotten hastily at a drugstore when we realized we left her toys at home while on vacation. We fill this with Zukes or with crushed Nuturo choice snacks and leave it for her when we go to work. This can be a really long toy for your dog due to the small opening near the rope and it's good to check that what you put in will actually come out. Our dog gets her treats out be picking this up by the rope and then flinging it across the room (much to the chargin of the tenants below our apartment). She also just chews on the rope when she is bored and also tries to tug the rope back and forth in order to dislodge some of the treats. The best method for her however is to throw it and although it's durable, your wood floors may not like it and it can be somewhat noisy. But for this price, your dog will get a relatively long lasting treat dispenser that you can manipulate in order to increase or decrease the difficulty of earning their treat.",Neutral
"I have a dachshund/terrier mix who is 2 years old. I bought him the Busy Buddy for the same reason everyone else probably does: he needed more mental stimulation. I brought the toy home, loaded it up, and offered it to my dog. He quickly figured out the rope was restricting the flow of treats. He promptly chewed through the rope, leaving a knot in the bottom of the bottle and the rest of the rope and other knot on the floor. Without this restriction he figured out (within a matter of minutes) that if he threw the bottle into the air, the bottle would bounce, sending a treat or two flying out of the mouth and onto the floor. It should also be noted that this toy IS breakable. However, your pup would have to have pretty strong jaws like my dog's.<br /><br />Synopses: Great toy if your dog isn't smart enough to chew through the rope or try to break the koosh ball.",Neutral
"Purchased our Tug a Jug after my 12yr old beagle shredded an Atomic Treat Ball. I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'. These were both issues with the ATB. I did remove the rope IMMEDIATELY after buying it because 1) its not able to be thoroughly cleaned and 2) it is a MAJOR igastro-intestinal blockage risk should your dog injest all or some of it(I've seen this first hand, I work at a vet). Its an expensive, invasive surgery that can be easily prevented with the TAJ if you remove the rope!<br /><br />My dislikes for the TAJ are:<br /><br />*The rope. I'm still surprised that dog toy manufacturers still use rope in their products despite the documented risks to and actual deaths of beloved pets! Toys should not be a death trap. Shame on you Busy Buddy.....<br /><br />*You can't adjust the kibble opening or dispensing rate of the kibbles. My dog figured out the first day that if he picks up the base LOTS of kibbles come out. I do understand this is due in part to my removing the rope, but its still an issue. Its annoying since he's not really 'working' for the food and he's done after just a few minutes, bored again. I've had better success plugging Kong toys with peanut butter or cream cheese and freezing them.<br /><br />*My dog will only play with it on the carpet because of the noisy, yet more sturdy hard plastic. It is very noisy on our kitchen linoleum and I can't begin to imagine it on tile! Blue prefers the carpet for more silent snacking, but this means dog food on my carpet and carpet fuzzies on the TAJ :( We've sort of solved this with making him snack on a small mat/rug that can be cleaned.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I would recommend this toy to pets that are not heavy chewers, as I don't think this would stand up to pits, rotties and other heavy chewing/large breed dogs. Its also a great toy for dogs that aren't such gifted problem solvers(like my beagle) since it IS such a simple design. Also a breeze to clean and fill with the screw-on base for the owner and it will hold a good amount of kibble.",Neutral
"My puppy loved this toy...but it lasted less than a month! The rope was easily chewed up in a matter of minutes when my back was turned - unlike most other rope toys we have that have lasted since we got her 6 months ago. Then, she was tossing it around with the remains of the rope, and the bottle hit the floor and the screw on end broke. So, now we can't put treats or toys in the bottle - which is the whole point of the toy! If your dog isn't a rough player, then this is a great toy...once they figure it out. I was very disappointed that this seemingly tough product broke so quickly.",Neutral
"My parents have a Carolina Dog who is not a big chewer. She loves this toy, and it keeps her occupied for a while. Seeing how much she loved it, I decided to get one for my 1 year old beagle. Within an hour or so, he had the rope completely chewed up which takes away the real intention of the toy. He still plays with the bottle itself, but there's no point in putting treats in it because they just fall out. This toy is not for hardcore chewers.",Neutral
"My dog will tug at the rope and push the bottle around until every last bit of kibble is out of there, but she doesn't like playing with it nearly as much as the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F0RRUA"">Premier Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Dog Toy</a>. Both of my dogs will play with that ball (and chew on it) for hours. Keeps them both busy and away from my shoes!",Neutral
"its a free for all in my house when i fill up the busy buddy -- and both the dogs and the cat get involved (the cat loves dog kibble lol) i do have to use the largest kibble i can find to make it more difficult.  However, the dogs have discovered that they can pick it up and swing it around like a mace... which gives them a weapon against my furniture, tv etc --- so i had to put it way - is its way to dangerous...  i bought the busy buddy tumbler instead - which is a great alternative.",Neutral
"I got the medium/large toy and it is really big.  I have two large dogs and only one of them can carry this around. It is definitely a tough toy, but my dogs only play with it when there are treats inside. Then they get the treats out and don't touch it again until I put more treats in it.  I thought they would chew on it even when no treats were inside because they always want plastic bottles which I don't like them to have. Overall, this toy is durable and a good toy if your dog will play with it.",Neutral
"It seems like a nice durable toy but my dog could care less.  A few sniffs, nose up, and that was that.  Doesn't matter what treats are in it or even if we dispense them.  I thought it would be nice for a bored dog, but this is a dog that, apparently, prefers boredom to gastric pleasure.  I gave it 3 stars because it does seem to be well constructed, but not five stars since it was utterly pointless purchase, at least for me.",Neutral
Have a border collie that I was hoping would love this toy.  It is sturdy enough and well made but I can't find any kibble that fits.  Anything I have put in the jar is too large for the dog to successfully get out.  Right now she just walks around with the rope in her mouth and the jar dangling.  Just be aware that it takes a very small treat to go in the jar.,Neutral
"I gave this to my dogs to see how they'd take to it.  They both seem confused by it.  At first it just sat on the floor, untouched for a couple of days.  I figured I'd try to lure them into playing with it by putting some really really yummy people food in it for them to sniff out. That definitely worked.  But they lose interest in the toy itself once the treats are gone.  Unlike another toy I purchased that they play with whether or not it has treats in it.<br />You have to show your dog how the treats slide out when you tug on the rope. I don't think my dogs are stupid but they just didn't get it until I went over it a couple of dozen times with them.",Neutral
"Even though I used small puppy kibble, my puppy could not get the kibble out of the bottle. For the treats to come out, the dog needs to pull on the rope and whip the bottle around. Because of the shape of the bottle, the kibble will not spill out on its own while lying on its side. I would think that holding onto the rope and whipping it around would be quite dangerous for the dog as well as anyone standing nearby - the bottle is made from hard plastic and would definitely hurt if it hit you.<br /><br />I decided to remove the rope completely and tried putting in a little ball to slow down the flow of the kibble. That didn't work either - the ball completely blocked the opening (maybe I'll try again with a smaller ball). In the end, I just ended up putting a larger treat (a small milkbone biscuit) in with the kibble and that seemed to work a little better. My puppy is able to get the treats to spill out by tipping the bottle upright. I think I need to experiment more with different sized balls or milkbone biscuits so the kibble spills out easily, but not too easily.<br /><br />On the plus side, the large opening on the bottom of the bottle is great. It makes it very easy to fill the bottle with kibble or treats.<br /><br />I gave this product a 3 because it does what I wanted - it slows down my puppy's eating and keeps him busy for a little while, but for us, it didn't work the way it was intended to work and has the possibility of injuring the dog.",Neutral
"I was all excited to find a toy that my smart, chew happy dog could play with. What I did not keep in mind, is that she is scared of anything that relates to people, even if it has food in it (she is a shelter rescue). She likes me getting food out for her, but never got into bouncing it around to figure out how to get food out herself. Two weeks later it is lying in a corner, ignored, full of yummy treats. I still think this toy has great potential, but I don't recommend it for a timid dog, that gets spooked easily. My dog loves her Kong chew toys. I was hoping to find something that will take longer to get the treats out.",Neutral
"My dog just got mad they couldn't get the treats out and ripped the rope right out.<br />He's a pretty strong chewer but not extraordinary. He's only a 70 lb coonhound.<br />Just an FYI to ya'll. I thought it was a little difficult for them to get treats but maybe my dogs aren't the smartest.<br />Anyway, the search continues for the perfect dog toy.",Neutral
within five minutes my 11 month old 60 lb collie/saint Bernard mix had chewed the rope in half.  I used suggestion given by another reviewer and put a racket ball in the bottle.,Neutral

"This is a great toy, but the bottle is just too big for a small dog.  The only way to get the treats out is to turn the bottle upside down and my dog's mouth is too small to grab the base of the bottle and he weighs 20 lbs.  He can demolish a bully stick in less than five minutes, but cannot grab the base of this bottle to stand it on it's top.  It's a clever toy for a medium to large dog!",Neutral
My golden just picks up the bottle and dumps everything out.  Larger dogs should use to big one that they can't get their mouth around.,Neutral
"I bought the Tug Jug for my dog because she was jealous of the cat's Slim Kitty food dispenser and she likes to play with rope toys.  I guess jealousy and rope are not enough motivation for her to play with it.  They need to be very food motivated because it is very challenging to get the treats out, and unfortunately she isn't a big eater.  It is a very sturdy and well made toy, and it is not as easy for them to get the food out as the other treat dispensing toys that roll around.  She only shows interest in it if I play with it with her.  I could see how it would be a great toy for the very food motivated dog who has a lot of dexterity.  Also a funny side note, the package came to me opened by the post office already because apparently on x-ray in looks like something dangerous.  Someone thought that a person would buy a molotov cocktail on Amazon, I guess.",Neutral
"I have a 16lb Dachsund and we have a very hard time finding toys that she is interested in. We adopted her, and her home before us was as a breeder at a puppy mill where they kept her in a crate her whole life. So long story short, she has no idea what to do with toys and really, I'm out of ideas. She gets interested at first, but has a really hard time manuevering the bottle to get the treats out (she has had back surgery to repair paralysis in her hind end from ruptured discs so is not super agile). Also I think my little wiener has a little trouble figuring it out and I'm not sure how else to show her. I do like to toy and it has withstood her frustrations but I think I need more help with it. Some helpful hints or instructions would be greatly appreciated.",Neutral
I gave this item a three because it only lasted a couple of hours before my 2 year old Wheaten Terrier chewed the rubber cord apart.

"My dog just isn't a ""tugger"" by nature. She doesn't get this toy, and the same hard plastic that makes it super durable also makes it super LOUD when it hits the hardwood floor. Noise=scary. My dog developed a phobia of this toy long before she ever figured out how to get the food out of it. I had to pass it along to someone else. Hopefully it will find a home with a dog who really loves it.",Neutral
"The toy got a lot of interest, but I eventually had to take it away because of the way my dogs chose to play with it. They would grab it by the rope and shake their heads to release this treats, subsequently beating walls (or worse, human legs) that were near them. It appeared to be sturdy, and probably would have been a good toy otherwise.",Neutral
"Got this for my West Highland Terrier for Christmas and she loved it.  It kept her busy as soon as we gave it to her.  She was completely focused on getting those treats out of the bottle...however, she re-invented the toy and got all of the treats out by actually chewing through the thick rope that is attached to the toy.  (She managed to do this in about 5 minutes in a roomful of people.)  It's a cute toy and a great concept - and she did enjoy it - however, I think this toy would work best with a dog who is not quite as focused, or creative in problem-solving as our westie seems to be.  The plastic bottle and rubbery ball are very sturdy and are continuing to hold up well.",Neutral
"I followed all the instructions and great guidance from this site, but my dog - a rescue dog, formerly an outside dog and not used to 'toys' didn't figure this out. Perhaps if another dog showed him the way, he'd get it. The product otherwise was well-made and a creative idea!",Neutral
"While the concept is great - my dog LOVES empty pop bottles - he doesn't have any interest in this particular toy. I think it is pretty sturdy, though I may not be the best judge as he hasn't really played hard with it. He has a ton of toys and this is his least favorite. It really is a good idea though and I do like how well it was made.",Neutral
My beagle really enjoyed working to get his treats out of this ball for the first couple days then he chewed through the rubber piece for tugging so now if we put treats in they just fall out.,Neutral
"We had an earlier model of this jug, with a rope instead of the rubber ""rope.""  My dog was able to get the food out a little easier, which I preferred.  This rubber thing in the middle quite effectively blocks the food and my dog gives up.  She used to eat her whole meal everyday in the old jug.  So I am disappointed they changed it.",Neutral
"My youngest Miniature Schnauzer is very food driven. I'm not sure why but he has always had a bad habit of ""wolf""ing down his food.  I have resorted to locking him in a seperate room, away from my other two Miniature Schnauzers, placing a tennis ball in the middle of his bowl and feeding him large kibble sized chunks of food to get him to slow down during feeding time.<br /><br />Toys like the ""Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug"" is great to keep him busy and entertained because if there is food in there, he's going to work at it until he can get to it.<br /><br />It took him a little while to 'get' that the food comes out of the front of the jug and previously he was trying to pry off the bottom, chew the front , purple hard rubber ring around the neck of the bottle and then he finally figured out how to get the food out and is content trying to do so until all the food it gone.<br /><br />My other two are just not that determined.<br /><br />I agree with everyone here, if you have an aggressive chewer this may not be the best toy but if your dog isn't an aggressive chewer but a food driven dog this toy will keep him busy.",Neutral
"My Westie liked this at first, but it didn't really hold his interest.  Plus, you have to fill the bottle about half full.  He gets bored after removing a few items, and then you either have to waste the food by replacing it with smellier food, or just leave it sitting around.  I think I just need to try with food he enjoys more, but I wanted the point to be that he would eat his regular food from this toy.",Neutral
"I bought the largest size available which was described as ""medium/large"" for my 25lb dog.  The toy was delivered and was too big.

My dog was fine with playing with it on the carpet, but on linoleum or hardwood floors it's way too loud.  And who wants to use it on carpet when food leaves crumbs and stains?  The plastic bangs on the floor and my dog is timid to begin with and can't deal with the noise even with high reward treats.  I also don't want to teach him that making loud noises is okay. I returned this.  They should line the bottom and top sides of the bottle with the rubbery stuff so it isn't so noisy.",Neutral
"My boston loves this toy!  It keeps her busy for quite a while and she's a heavy chewer, so it held up... for a while.  Like others, she has managed to chew her way through the rubber rope that comes out the end, but only a little at a time.  I keep a good eye on it and when it looks like she's about to get another piece off, I just cut that little bit off with a pair of scissors.  But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.  So the good news is, great concept for a little dog (it's a small toy, don't give it to a lab, that's not what it was meant for), but maybe not as indestructable as they might think.  I'll buy another one, mainly because Roxy went into hysterics when I tried to hide it from her for a few days.  Clearly her favorite of all toys!  Doesn't want to eat out of her dish anymore!",Neutral
"I have a 45lb lab mix that loves his busy buddy, but that cheap rubber rope lasted all of 20 min with him. He chewed it down to a nub. A thicker rope or actual rope might be a better choice. Or maybe Kong like rubber!<br /><br />That said, he goes bonkers for this and clangs it noisily all around on the hardwood floors. It gets to be a bit much. But he sure has fun!",Neutral
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:01 Mins<br /><br /></span>This video shows Taxi (soft coated wheaten terrier) opening and playing with his Christmas/10th Birthday present... a Tug-a-Jug. He's played with it a few times now and he still doesn't get that he needs to pull the cord to get the treats to come out -- although he really enjoys knocking it around until the treats accidentally fall out. I bought the large size after reading the reviews because of the cord. The large size had the plastic cord which is easier to clean. The smaller size has the rope cord. Taxi is not a big chewer, so I felt comfortable that this toy would durable - and it is. I filled it with stinky treats which he can smell through both ends... but those treats upset his tummy a bit, so I'm going to have to try something else. I couldn't find the ingredients of the treats that are sold with the Tug-a-Jug, so I didn't buy those.",Neutral
"It's a good concept, but the rope part of the tug a jug is not as durable as I thought.  My Corgi/Australian Shepherd puppy cleanly separated the rope into 2 pieces so now it's just a jug.",Neutral
"There are 2 design issues with this toy: 1. in order for the rope to go back in, it needs to be PUSHED back in - this is difficult for a dog to accomplish without human help as it is not a stiff rope, but a flexible one. 2. When the dog pulls on the rope, it lifts the bottle up into an upright position, and when it's vertical the treats don't come out.<br /><br />My dog quickly figured out that the best way for the toy to ""work"" was if I set it up and let him pull the rope out while I held the bottle horizontal. So my dreams of independent play have not yet been realized.",Neutral
"Our pit mix loves to chew especially when bored.  We bought this thinking it was cheap enough and it might last a week.  He chewed through the rope within a day.  He loves the purple bottle though and carries it around the yard, sometimes trying to chew through that but he has not been successful.  We have been looking for maybe some kind of thick rope from a ship or something, maybe then this toy would work for our boy.",Neutral
"I was dissapointed in this one. The only way to get the treats out is to tug it on the ground but the rope encourages the dog to carry it around, throw it around etc... You have to fill it up to get the treats to come out and sorry but I don't want to give my dog 2 days worth of food. Maybe I would have been better off buying the smaller one.",Neutral
"Works great for my GSD with one exception. I had to remove the rubber rope from the bottle. Otherwise it would be impossible to get the food out!! Maybe this is because his food is larger I really dont know however, with the rope gone he stays active until all the food is out. Good buy since I purchased it from target at the clearanced price of 3 dollars!",Neutral
"I have a 3 year old black lab named Layla who LOVED the busy buddy.  It got to the point where she enjoyed having some of her meals put in the toy each day.  Layla never really chewed on the toy, just picked it up and dropped it, etc.  After about 2 weeks though the screw off bottom developed a crack that eventually split the top. The plastic on the screw off top doesn't seem as thick or sturdy as the rest.  I thought about buying this toy again, but decided to try a treat toy made of rubber which is her new infatuation! If you have a gentle dog and carpet try this toy out, but if you have a large one and hardwood floors maybe think twice!",Neutral
"I got the large size for my siberian husky. He sniffed around the treat-filled bottle and turned away. I tried to show him how to get the treats out by pulling the rope, rolling the bottle, etc, he watched me doing it, and still not interested in trying for himself. He didn't even try to bite the bottle. He played with normal water bottles for hours but he just don't think this tug-a-jug is worth any attention. Personally I think it's a great idea how they designed the toy, but I just can't get my dog to play with it. Later I introduced this toy to my coworker, who has a little puggle, and he immediately got one. He puggle chewed up the spiked ball on the bottle neck within 5 minutes...so I guess it's not that durable then.",Neutral
"The Tug-A-Jug is a cleverly designed toy that does a good job of entertaining/occupying a dog, but my 85 pound Weimaraner destroyed the largest model inside of a few hours. It's also noisy for indoor use.",Neutral

My 70lbs. lab/hound mix likes this toy OK. He hasn't figured out how it works to get the food out but he does like to carry it around in his mouth by the rope. Not as entertaining for him as I hoped but we're still giving him time to figure it out. We've tried to show him but he's never gotten the food out on his own and he's a pretty smart dog. -B,Neutral
"We just bought this toy, and it is definetly something our dog loves and is interested in for a good period of time. It took her less than 20 minutes to figure out she just had to chew through the rope. If they could do a second version with a rope made of Kevlar or a metal chain with knots -that would be much better!",Neutral
"I think the problem with this toy is that the rope fills up too much of the bottle neck which makes getting a treat out of the container nearly impossible.  It is certainly a sturdy product though, but having Boxers I can just imagine one of them grabbing it by the rope and swinging it around, and breaking something in my house.",Neutral
"Very duriable item.  85-lb dog hasn't destroyed it yet.  It drops food rather fast though.  If you want more regular food coming out, get this toy.",Neutral
"I got this for my 60lb boxer mix as a replacement for smaller one he had managed to break by dropping it. It was great for a couple days, but after that he seemed to get frustrated & in a mere 24 hours, he had chewed through the much thicker rope on the new one, which he had never thought of doing on the old one.  Another new toy, doomed to failure.  &lt;sigh>  oh well, at least I tried.",Neutral

"My one year old pit mix is incredibly food motivated and can clean out any kong, no matter how tightly stuffed, in 10 minutes. I got this toy to keep her busy, and while it does take her a long time to clean it out, the toy is simply too loud. Roxy likes to kick this toy across the floor, sending it flying into the wall or the table. The hard plastic of the toy scrapes across the hard wood floor and then makes a loud ""bang"" as it slams into things. Not only is the noise really annoying, but I am also worried she might break something because the bottle is very hard.",Neutral
"I have a 5 month old Australian shepherd and she could not get the treats out--we couldn't either. What we finally ended up doing was boring a hole at the bottom; luckily my husband had the tools to make a smooth hole big enough for her kibbles.

My 14 month old Border Collie wanted nothing to do with this toy... so I gave it to my freinds 12 month old Lab ...and he also ignored it.. so now it just sits there... I cant even give it away :0(,Neutral
"Pretty cool idea.  Lab loved it for a while...then it broke when it got tossed onto the driveway - bye, bye, toy!",Neutral
"My dog managed to chew threw the rubber tug in less than 30 seconds.  That being said, I can't say that the toy is a total loss.  I turned the leftover part upside down in the jug and it is fairly effective at slowing down the dispensation of the food treats that are inside.  Keeps mine amused for as long as the food is in there",Neutral
"I have two large dogs that are super chewers; they destroy just everything so I was excited to try the tug-a-jug out because of the claim of durable construction.<br /><br />The plastic bottle itself is holding up well.<br /><br />The ""rope,"" which is a rubber/plastic flexible piece that plugs the top of the jug is another story. The half of it that extends out of the jug that is meant for tugging was chewed off in about an hour. It did not crumble or flake though, which was a relief interms of safety. Thankfully, another reviewer had the same experience so I kept a close watch on this. The other  half  still remains in the jug and stills works fine as a plug to keep the treats inside the jug.<br /><br />The other rubber/plastic piece that surrounds the next of the jug/bottle is slowly being chewed away. Many of the flexible dental spikes were also chewed off within the first hour. After a week of use, the main piece has some tears in it. My guess is that it will break off soon.<br /><br />The dogs really like it. One of them sat for two hours trying to get her treats out, so this was a worth while purchase in terms of a toy or  activity that actually keeps my dog busy. There was no tugging though. The dogs just sat and held it in their paws occaisionally rolling it to shift the treats around to get them out.<br /><br />This toy is really not that different than the Kongs that I have, which have survived two years of chewing! The dogs could care less that they can see the treats because they are too busy trying to stick their faces into the open end. This is not a noisy toy.",Neutral
"I thought this toy would be great for my dog.  He was in desperate need of mental stimulation and I thought if he could figure out a puzzle while he was eating his dinner that would be great.  However, within the first 20-30 minutes he had it, the rubber ""tug"" rope was broken in half.  I think he chewed on it some, but I think the actual cause of it breaking was being bent since it was a smooth break instead of jagged.  He still uses it though, even without the rope.  Instead of tugging it now he'll stand it upright, knock it over, and eat the spilled contents or sometimes he'll turn it upsidedown.  Even though he isn't using it the way it was meant to be he still likes it and gets a lot of use out of it.",Neutral
"When i got this for my dog, Hilde, i gave it to her and then left for about half an hour.  It had her breakfast kibble in it.  When i came back to check up on her she was trying to use it but couldn't figure it out.  There was also the same amount of food when i came back.  I had to try to help her with it and it was still hard for her.  It was pretty sad because she was going ballistic because she couldn't get the food out.  It seemed like a good idea at first but i dont think my dog very much liked it.  There are scent holes at the bottom and she could see the treats inside so she would try to eat the plastic!  Either this wasnt a very well thought out toy or my dog is dumb! Hope this review helps.",Neutral
"My dog really enjoyed this. she spent hours trying to get the treats out. but in the first 10 minutes she chewed the plastic 'rope' in half out of frustration. So now the toy doesn't work as intended, but still i put her dog food in there since i know she'll be able to get it out pretty easily, it will just take more work than the bowl. This is a really great toy, just wish the rope would have lasted a day. so be sure to supervise play before you leave your dog with this one.",Neutral
"I received my order this chocolate quickly and it was well packed. There was no damage to the chocolate from heat. In fact the merchandise was in the very good condition.<br /><br />The confection itself had nothing specific to recommend it. Oh, it was good but it was not remarkably good. I believe one day just as well by buying supermarket chocolate. In my opinion this was definitely not gourmet chocolate.<br /><br />Therefore, although I don't have anything actually negative to say about this stuff, I don't think it is worth the price and again I think one is better off buying chocolate in the supermarket, since the quality of their product is as good as this.",Neutral

"I like some of the Snickers Marathon bar flavors, but not this one.  It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't come close to tasting like the dark chocolate its name denotes.  Mostly this just tastes sweet.<br /><br />For many people, this might be a healthy snack substitution.  Each bar has only 150 calories yet has 11 grams of protein and 22 grams of carbs (9 grams of sugar).  It's also fortified with many vitamins (100% USRDA of many of them), but I take a multivitamin daily already so this doesn't mean much to me.  My main complaint about the nutritional profile of this bar is that it just has too much fiber for such a small amount of food.  If you're someone who doesn't eat fresh fruits and vegetables and prefers refined foods (white flour, white rice, white bread, etc) rather than whole grain foods, then the fiber in this bar would do you good.  For me, however, the 7 grams of fiber per bar (28% of the USRDA) causes me intestinal discomfort as it adds to an already high daily consumption of fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  I assume that some of the fiber in this bar comes from its principal ingredient (soy), but I also see that chicory fiber is listed as an ingredient and chicory root has a high concentration of fiber.  If I were to reformulate this product, I'd remove the chicory fiber and do something to attempt to give it a bit more authentic of a chocolate flavor.",Neutral
"I know this is supposed to be sweetened and creamy. But drinking a cup of it, I could not shake the idea that I was instead drinking a hot and melted tube of cake icing. Detecting the coffee flavoring which was supposed to allow it to be called 'coffee' was really difficult.<br /><br />Buying it because of the pre-made convenience (and okay the cheap selling price) is self-defeating when the coffee does not taste like coffee. It was next to impossible for me to detect! So, I'd rather pay a little more for halfway deccent coffee, and have to obtain milk and sugar separately.<br /><br />It's certainly not the type of product which you would want to serve in a 'high society' environment hoping to impress your guests about knowledge of coffee. It's international, but the coffee concept is not on par with Italian Cappuccino.<br /><br />But on a plus side, you can drink several cups of this stuff without worrying if it will keep you up at night. It either is decaffeinated. Or the existing caffeine content in the product is so low that it does not affect people with sensitivity.",Neutral
"I bought this as a gift for my mom.  She loved the box and the candy was tasty but if you look at the picture in their advertisement it must be a close up because what I saw come out of the box looked like about half of what they show.  Truthfully, unless you're into home made candy, save your money and buy some English Toffee at Walmart.  It's probably just about as good and a lot less expensive.",Neutral
"I bought this product and it arrived in a crushed case as Amazon does not re-box the shipment. I like reduced packaging, but in this case, the product suffers as a result, and several (10+) of the packages were open and perhaps not safe for use.  The other issue is the packages are more than a few months old at the time of shipment.  Several months ago Kellogs started adding fiber to certain cereals, including Special K, and these do not have any fiber- they are probably working off old stock. In spite of all this, I would purchase again- these are great for portion control, which is difficult for cereal, and these would be perfect for food service, day cares, day camps, churches and other groups. I plan on throwing some in my suitcase for travel- most processed prepackaged foods are approved for entry into other countries and these will be good on the go. Hopefully in the near future Amazon will get newer stock with the added fiber.  Make no mistake, Special K is not something most people would consider healthy- high fructose corn syrup is one of the main ingredients and with the lack of fiber, this is little better than a kids cereal, but I do like it for a treat when I am craving something sweet.  Plus they are only 70 calories per portion, and you can add your skim milk right to the container. These portions do not cost any more ounce per ounce than the regular boxes I purchase at the grocery store.",Neutral

I've tried the lemon in some of the WuLong tea [ick..guess I should try a better tasting tea?] noticed the after taste, as usual.  I've also tried the strawberry in some carbonated water [suggestion from the 101 Recipes for the HCG protocol] and that's not too bad.  Definitely something you gotta get use to...because of the after taste.

I've actually had a little better luck with the Nu-Stevia powder, as long as I am careful on the amount [for example I use it in my smoothies, i.e. 1 packet for a 16-20oz smoothie].

I've purchased 2 packages of 4 boxes each about two weeks ago ,the first boxes were great and I have no complaints ..but when I opened the second 4 boxes the cereal was either over baked or under baked ,because it had some really hard cereal pieces and when chewing it felt like I was eating hard candy with milk ,I thought that maybe it was just one box that it was like that but no ,I checked all 4 boxes and they were all the same ,not what I expected at all,I'm disappointed at Amazon for not having a higher product quality check and offering defective boxes like that and since I can't return groceries ..makes it a very frustrating experience ,that's why I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars ,the cereal itself is my favorite ..it has the greatest chocolate flavor and a unique taste that in my opinion has no match ,this is a great product indeed ,though I would not recommend you to purchase it from Amazon ,better buy it at your local grocer to avoid frustrations.",Neutral
"I have no idea if this tastes like the real thing (I'm going to guess no), but it is very tasty.  It's easy to make and is filling.  Most instant noodles are either too bland or too spicey for me, but this has a perfectly seasoned broth.  The noodles are firm without being too tough like some of the Annie Chun soup bowls.  I really liked the huge pieces of green onion in it as well.  Good product and my new favorite flavor.<br /><br />Huge downside?  1940mg of sodium per bowl, which is more sodium then you need in day never mind one meal.  Ouch.

"I knew it was a pipe dream to think this product would be 'good' pho, but as an avid pho lover, I had to try it. The verdict? It doesn't really taste like Pho, but it's pretty good WITH some work.<br /><br />Eating this stuff right out of the box is a sure letdown for any person who desires something that actually tastes like Pho. I adore two things about Annie Chun noodle bowls, and that's the dehydrated vegetables and noodles. The veges rehydrate and look/taste like somewhat fresh veges, which is a feat on its own. The noodles are thick and chewy, which I enjoy. However... they just don't belong in pho. The noodles are totally uncharacteristic of real pho, and the veges are missing some important flavors (namely cilantro). On top of all that, the sauce to make the broth really tastes nothing like pho broth. I searched and searched for that cinnamon and star anise that you generally taste in real pho, and it's just not there.<br /><br />On the plus side, it's pretty easy to soup this up (pun fully intended). To get this to taste like a halfway decent bowl of pho like I'm used to, I add a few things. First and foremost, a hefty amount of sriracha sauce (I like my pho's broth to be a rich red, very spicy, but delicious). I also take some steak and slice it very thinly, layer it on the bottom of the bowl, and pour the boiling water over it and allow it to sit for 3-4 mins to get a nice med-rare cut of meat in there. While that's sitting, I dice up a good amount of cilantro and toss that in, along with a good handful of bean sprouts. Once that's all in, I put in a pinch of sugar (the sauce has a sour aftertaste if you don't), and then I eat. Sounds like a lot of work, but it takes me about 15 minutes to make a very filling bowl of ""pho"". It still isn't quite there as the broth is missing some complex flavors, but it's actually not bad. I would give it 4-4.5 stars after said additions are done.",Neutral
"I never use the whole sauce packet, there's some fish sauce in it that just overwhelms the whole bowl with a salty taste I don't like. If I use 1/2 or less of the sauce packet it doesn't overwhelm the dehydrated veggies, and is ok - not my favorite though.",Neutral
"I've been eating Annie's Mac n' Cheese (not the whole wheat type) since 1994.  Amazon offers a excellent price (around $1.50 per box for certified organic, whoa!) and if I'm going to commit upfront to 12 boxes of mac and cheese, I figured I try to be a little healthier and get the whole wheat type.<br /><br />It is a quality product but it isn't suited to my taste buds.  I am surprised because I prefer brown rice and wild rice to white rice and generally enjoy whole wheat products.  But to this eater, the whole wheat shells were too heavy and chewy.  The watery white cheddar sauce enhanced the pasta's rougher texture and blandness.  (The white cheddar sauce is like an alfredo, and less creamy than Annie's regular cheddar.)  My friends love this stuff, but I think it's an acquired tasted.  If I had known what I know now, I'd have stuck with the enriched white (yet stripped of it's nutrients) shells or at least gone with the regular cheddar sauce.<br /><br />*Update*<br />While still not a full-on fan, I enjoying this product more now that:<br /><br />1.  Tastes much better when cooked 10-11 minutes at sea-level (the box recommends 8-10), the texture is less rough and gummy and is more noodle-y.<br /><br />2.  Adding fresh herbs with the cheese sauce.  It gives a depth to the flavor.  My favorite herb to add (so far) is cilantro (add about 1/3 cup chopped after mixing in the cheese sauce).  Other enjoyable variations were adding 2/3 cup of Italian parsley or 1/8 cup fresh dill leaves.",Neutral
"All by itself, I would have to give this a 3.  But, as I've learned with most packaged food, it can be easily made into a 5.  I prepare as described on the box and top with mixed Italian herbs, crushed red pepper, and a pinch of shredded Parmesan.  Not only does it look more appetizing, but it tastes great!  And these are things I usually keep around the house, so I just grabbed whatever I had and it only adds about 30 seconds to the prep process.  I highly recommend if you're willing to add things you like to flavor it up.",Neutral
"I honestly don't care for the taste of the white cheddar. It was too bland and chalky for me (not smooth and creamy).

"Summary: Set an alarm to wake up 4.5 hours after falling asleep, take around 10mL of tincture and then go back to sleep for strongly enhanced dream recall, vividness, and possible lucid dreams, OBEs or other phenomena.<br /><br />I have been a lucid dreamer for over a year now, usually having 1-2 per week as well as remembering 2+ dreams most night, so I'm pretty in tune to noticing a change in my dreams. When this arrived I immediately noticed this tincture comes with no dosage information, so I looked around in the comments and decided to start with 1 dropper (roughly 1mL), and didn't notice any difference in the vividness of my dreams. I upped the dose to 3mL the next night, still no effect.  The next night I tried 5mL and smoked a bowl of mj before bed, and it added a nice dreamy feel to the bud and I noticed strong hypnagogic hallucinations as i was falling asleep, but there was no increase in dream recall or vividness, I assumed because of the bud. So I tried 6mL with no smoke, and there was not much difference. A little frustrated at this point i tried a tablespoon, around 15mL, and this worked. That night I had a lucid dream followed by an out of body experience and a few false awakening, much better dream recall and increased vividness. Since then I have experimented with a few different doses, and for the most part have had success by taking 7mL+ a few hours after going to sleep.",Neutral

I have purchased these chunks from Amazon for several years since most local groceries no longer carry the chunks.

"I ordered this coffee for my daughter to try. She's a second year med student and has had some Gerd and Lerp problems. Coffee was something that she's always liked but had to give up because of acid reflux. Although the Amazon Vine offer clearly said that they would send ten 3 ounce bags, only one bag was delivered. I emailed back and asked them to send the correct order.  Lo and behold, they once again sent one bag. I contacted them one more time to explain that there must be a coding problem in their system but this time I wasn't favored with a response. In the hundreds of orders that I've processed through Amazon over the years, this is the first time that Amazon has made a shipping mistake and not cleared it up.<br /><br />So both my daughter and I tried a cup. Neither one of us had any acid reaction -- but neither one of us would have ordered it again based on the taste. We both like a stronger and bolder cup of coffee and this one was weak with some sort of strange after-taste. Not exactly our cup of tea. Keep trying though, a lot of people with acid reflux are looking for a great cup of coffee.",Neutral

"Okay, I'll admit it.... I am a coffee snob.  I have loved coffee since I was old enough to steal a sip from my parents' cup at the breakfast table... and that was too many years ago for me to tell you here.

I love a dark roasted, full flavored coffee and have tried many French Roasts, which this is 'supposed' to be.  It was dull and flatter than any generic decaf and truly unappealing to me.  I would rather have one cup of 'good' coffee than pots of mediocre brew.<br /><br />This is a coffee that left me feeling as if I had drank a coffee substitute and not even a good one at that.  If you are looking for low acid coffee, try a good Ethiopian or one of the many naturally less acidic coffees out there and pass this one by.  It left me totally lacking in coffee satisfaction.  The aroma was wonderful in the pot, but the taste was of the 'brown water' variety.  It needs work in my opinion.",Neutral

Nevertheless, I brewed a cup to check it out and was pleasantly surprised by the taste.  it brews a pretty mellow, smooth cup of coffee.  It's not incredibly flavorful, no subtle hints of this or that, but it's many steps above folgers or other cheapie coffees.<br /><br />In sum, it's not as good as premium coffees,but if you miss the taste because of acid issues, this is a good option.",Neutral
"If you are expecting the x-bold, smokey, gourmet flavor of a Starbucks or Seattle's Best, you may be reaching for a miracle that isn't there. I grew up in the 60s with a younger brother who needed to use sacchrine on everything because of his diabetes. Sacchrine is absolutely no sugar substitute. Anyone who has used it knows.<br /><br />The Puroast Low Acid is really not a bad alternative if you need a low acid blend because of acid reflux, sensitive stomachs, etc. Was it weaker than what we're used to? Certainly. Is it bolder than, say, Folgers medium roast. I would say that it is. Though milder than most bold roasts (that's a dead giveaway in opening the pouch. But that is probably because of its finer grind than even the mild and medium roasts with a coarser mill. The finer the grind, the lower the aroma retention. Yet, because it is a finer grind, the taste is much bolder than the smell would give away.<br /><br />This is also a smoother tasting French roast than I was expecting (possibly because of its fine grind), but it was a very pleasant taste.<br /><br />The cost and the flavor may be inconsequential to those who do really need a low acid coffee. For that reason, it was hard for me to rate using the star system because I am a coffee lover without a low acid need. Perhaps someone with a low acid need finds that this coffee is superb and would otherwise give it four or five stars.  If you are a regular coffee drinker, any flavor that isn't cultivated in what you are used to will make others, especially weaker blends seem more inferior than they probably are in reality. When I was in Asia, there were times when I would go weeks without a cup of coffee, and after that, the mildest of blends tasted oh so good to me.<br /><br />Although I was unable to try it in an espresso machine, the finer grind lends itself to espresso; and that may be something you might want to try with this blend to kick the flavor up another bold notch or two.<br /><br />Another possible idea is to use this blend in a French Press (yes, although I know the finer grind isn't typically conducive to the Press; perhaps a filter may be used).<br /><br />If you suffer from acid reflux, sensitive stomach, etc., this may be very worth the try for you.<br /><br />If you don't need the low acid beverage, stick with your standard brands.",Neutral
"Taste in coffee is subjective.  In fact, it's so subjective that it may well be meaningless to discuss it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, my judgement of this coffee is that it's pretty good, but it's really nothing special.  I thought the taste was on the same level as Seattle's Best, Tully's, or Starbucks bagged ground coffee.  It was better than lower-tier bagged ground coffee, but not outstanding.  This is pretty pricey coffee, too.  I can't judge the low acid aspect of the brew, because I generally don't have trouble with acid in coffee.<br /><br />In my admittedly subjective view, this coffee at this price just isn't any better than a three-star buy.",Neutral
My husband loves French Roast and does have trouble with acid after drinking coffee. This would be a great benefit to him but the cost would prevent us from buying it.<br /><br />The flavor was still too strong for me but then I like really light coffees. I tried it first without creamer and didn't like the taste. I added 1/3 cup of water as I usually do for any coffee and some sugar free French Vanilla Creamer. Then it was fine for me.<br /><br />I think we would buy it if it was sold at a cheaper price. Kudos for the company for making low acid coffee though.,Neutral
"....but on the plus side, no heartburn as I sometimes get when drinking coffee.  I made this 3 ounces (1 packet) to a full pot of water in my 12 cup drip coffeemaker, maybe that was the reason for the weakness.

Nice aroma and no bitterness, but unless my heartburn issues get worse in the future, I will stick to my regular mocha/espresso drinks and my CBTL machine.",Neutral
"While I like my coffee strong, I am slightly susceptible to acidic coffee - just not enough to have to seek out alternatives. If you are to that point, I would recommend this coffee as a good alternative, but if you are not quite to that point, this is not a substitute for great coffee. It's good enough to compete with the pre-ground mass-market coffees but doesn't match up to the more premium beans. It has a mild, nuttier flavor than I'm used to, and a hint of aftertaste comparable to a diet beverage.<br /><br />What confuses me is that the description claims this is a good choice for decaf drinkers looking for a more robust flavor. I'm not sure I agree with that, but what confuses me is: is this decaf or not? I didn't think so, but this claim makes it vague.<br /><br />20 minute later update: oops, definitely caffeinated... gotta run!",Neutral
"I definitely noticed a difference in the way my stomach reacted to this coffee -- much less acid, fewer jitters. However, while the French Roast coffee tastes pretty good, there is a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste that is unpleasant. Overall, this is just OK.",Neutral
"This is not a bad alternative for sensitive stomachs or for people who are overwhelmed by the acidity of coffee in general, but like the effects.  I wouldn't say that it has a robust taste, so if you're like me and like a good punch of taste first thing in the morning, this is definitely not going to hit the spot.  It advertises a more robust flavor than decaffeinated coffee, but it still doesn't compete in the flavor department with the the bolder flavors now avaialble. Like decaf, it contains a lot of sludge when you hit the bottom of the cup, but it's not strong.  The taste overall is like the weakest coffee blend you could find, so if you enjoy real french roast, this isn't even close.",Neutral
"At first I thought this coffee would be strong because it's French Roast.  However, it's extremely mild.  It has a nutty aroma when the packet is first opened.  The first sip has a mild nutty flavor, which goes away with each additional sip.<br /><br />I like drinking my coffee black, but can only do so with really good coffee that's not too strong.  Most coffees, I need to add non-fat milk to.  So, I first tried this coffee black.  Although it's very mild, and I didn't need milk to buffer the bitterness, I found it lacking in body.  With the next cup I added hot milk and it tasted much better.  It really needed the extra omph of the milk, even though it was non-fat.<br /><br />I didn't notice any heartburn afterwards, which is good.  But, I wasn't excited to drink it again.",Neutral
"I found it a bit flat, maybe because it lacked the aroma I associate with good coffee.  It tastes a bit muddy, but it did not seem acidic. It has a nice label! I have to say that I prefer Folger's.",Neutral
"If not for the low acid, I would never recommend this coffee. The taste was uneven and flat, not a French Roast by any stretch of the imagination.<br /><br />I like my coffee strong and smooth, and I figured that low acid would be reflected in a smoother taste, but it was not. To be fair, I have not had a lot of low acid coffees for comparison.  I suppose that if acid is a real concern, someone could drink this. I don't take milk and sugar, so maybe the addition of those would disguise...er, improve the taste.",Neutral
"unless you have heartburn, acid reflux, or mild stomach irritation that is directly attributable to coffee.  I have heartburn and acid reflux, currently treated by OTC acid reducers, and while I've found that certain foods and beverages seem to increase my symptoms, coffee doesn't appear to be one of them, especially since I experience my worst symptoms at night but only drink coffee in the morning (for the caffeine).

"As a rabid, unrepentant coffee-drinker, I had to try this product.  Although I love the flavor and texture of French roast coffee, it's acidity tends to wreak havoc once inside of me.  Given my (minimum) two-cup a day habit, coffee can be tough going, to say the least.<br /><br />The Puroast brand delivered on the caffeine, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, both straight and with cream.  I generally like my French roast to be strong, sharp and over-powering (so as to awaken me with a jolt and keep me fully hyped up), but the flip-side of this is typically very high acid content with the usual medical complaints.  To achieve that same full sensory experience, I had to use a bit more of it- about 1.5 times the usual amount of grounds that I brew of typical French roast in order to achieve a similar 'kick' from the coffee.<br /><br />In passing, I also like to spice up my coffee with either 1) a little cinnamon and Kahlua (usually during winter) or 2) one part twenty-year aged rum, minimum two parts Grand Marnier, chasing both with a strong batch of French roast filled to the rim of the mug (a kind of after-dinner dessert on the weekends for me).  I tried the latter recipe with and without a touch of cream, and while typically the coffee tends to eclipse the flavor of the alcohol mix, with Puroast both the aroma and taste of the aged rum and the Gran Marnier came through right nice as my ever-so-sensible British friends are fond of saying.  I also found that for best results with the combo of aged rum and Grand Marnier, Nestle's Coffee Mate French Vanilla product provided the best results, which featured a smooth, even finish combined with a creaminess that was, well, positively orgasmic!<br /><br />In sum, this product is an adequate and satisfying entry to the coffee space, and I highly recommend it to those who literally cannot 'stomach' their coffee.",Neutral

When I saw this low acid coffee I thought we had found a solution.  Unfortunately I was wrong.<br /><br />On the upside, he liked the mild taste of the brew and even enjoyed the smooth after taste. On the downside, he didn't enjoy it enough to make the switch from his usual store brand which is considerably less expensive.

"It's hard to review for this 3-ounce bag of coffee for two reasons; 1) three ounces is not a lot of joe to go by, and 2) the tests were performed in a brand new <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YPC2NM"">EZ-Cup for Keurig Coffee Machines By Perfect Pod</a>, but let me share the experience with you.<br /><br />First of all, if you have problems with acidic coffee, the chances are good your problems are not as bad as my Dad's issues with it.  He was the test subject because he loves coffee, and can rarely drink it.  He's had 2/3rds of his stomach removed... TWICE.  He's also had Barrett's Esophagus, and has undergone procedures to literally burn the potentially cancerous stuff from his throat.  His sensitivities to acidic foods or beverages are, as you can imagine, severe.  So when I saw a product sample offered on Amazon recently, I jumped at the opportunity for him.<br /><br />He was able to make two cups of coffee using the new K-Cup Pod, but reviews are incomplete because the experimentation with the amount to put in the K-Cup is complete.  There were no instructions as to amount to use on the package of coffee, so we had to guess by dead reckoning (to be honest and fair, even if we'd used a regular brewer, we still weren't sure how much water to put with the three ounces... we imagined that it would have been six.  So we looked at a video on YouTube from Perfect Pod which showed how much they put in, and we followed suit.  What came out, was, according to my Dad, ironically ""weak.""  We probably should have put in more, but the portion we'd used was exactly half the bag, so we didn't have enough left to try it again.  On the positive side, he suffered no ill effects from what he ingested, so that's a promising prospect..<br /><br />My Dad and I have ordered a one-pound bag of Puroast coffee to try again, this time the House Blend.  I will make a point of returning once we've had the time to test it, and I will update as soon as possible!",Neutral
"The first thing I noticed, after brewing a pot of this coffee, was that it did not have the wonderful coffee smell that I love so much. When I first started drinking it, I didn't like the flavor, it is full bodies, but there was definitely something missing. By my second cup, it was starting to taste better, not bad actually. So I guess when you first start drinking this coffee you will notice it's not the same as the coffee you might be use to. But after you drink only this coffee, you get use to the flavor and it becomes a good alternative to regular coffee.",Neutral
"The coffee is rich dark and beautifully low acid, meaning not stomach ache.<br /><br />However, that format of 3 once bags that are not resealable can be a challenge to deal with.<br /><br />They remind of the bags I used at restaurants to make coffee for the diners. 3 oz is enough to make one 12 cup pot of week coffee or 8 cups of tasty brew.<br /><br />But I am just one guy and 8 cups a day is a bit much for me.<br /><br />So, I decided to use a french press and that was a mistake, the grind is too fine, and I got some sludge at the bottom of my cup.<br /><br />Then the following day, I made a small pot, but since the pack was not resealable, I thought it had lost some of the aroma.<br /><br />This could be solved with a ziploc baggie I guess.<br /><br />Regardless of the wonky format, the coffee is good and it is low acid.  But then so is coffee made with a cold toddy tool like: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW"">Toddy T2N Cold Brew System</a>. The only draw back of the Toddy, is that coffee tastes like a different animal, but it is tasty, and low acid too (due to the cold brew process).  The Puroast Low Acid Coffee maintains that hot brewed coffee taste.",Neutral
"I liked the strong aroma of this french roast coffee, both from the pouch and when it was brewing.  But the flavor was off, and it left a strong aftertaste.  I do get heartburn on occasion, and can say I did not have any after drinking this.  However, the price is so very high, and the flavor is only mediocre, so it is hard to recommend this product, unless you absolutely cannot drink regular coffee without distress.",Neutral
"This coffee is not horrible by any means, but if you're a coffee drinker who really savors the flavor, you might want to look elsewhere. My husband has heartburn and loves coffee so we really thought we'd found something special when we discovered this low acid coffee but the taste just did not do it for us. Think of it like diet soda, not as good as the real thing, and over time you could probably develop a taste for it, but just lacking that something special.<br /><br />If you're not a picky coffee drinker, however, and just want something to wake you up without the acid, this might be a good alternative for you. I add a lot of flavored creamers to my coffee so it didn't seem as bad to me as it did to my husband, who drinks his coffee black. If you flavor your coffee a lot you probably won't mind the taste (or lack thereof) of this coffee as much.<br /><br />Just things to consider before you buy. It's a great idea since coffee can really aggravate heartburn, but just not as good as the real thing. I guess you have to decide which is more important to you: coffee taste even if it means constantly popping Tums OR sweet relief from heartburn while still getting your so-so morning java mojo?",Neutral
"I found it delicious, and found it shocking that I was able to drink at all, since I have not been able to drink much coffee at all for the past few years because of a really bad case of GERD.  I think Puroast so far is the best brand of coffee that I've tried in quite a while without resorting to the Toddy maker.  However, I still had some heartburn with this coffee, despite the fact that I'm also on Nexium.<br /><br />Everyone is different when it comes to toleration of acid, so I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying this coffee.  But I did want to warn those who suffer from bad cases of GERD, that you may not be able to drink Puroast either.",Neutral
"Coffee is one of my favorite things in life.  The decaf variety is usually as flavorful and fragrant as regular caffeinated coffee, so I pretty much expected a coffee with low acid to be at least comparable with decaffeinated.  Not exactly, but it might have been my fault.  After checking the package carefully I could find nothing that indicated how much water to use with the packet contents.  So, I made a regular 8 cup brew.  Upon opening the package I did not get the burst of wonderful coffee fragrance.  No coffee fragrance while brewing either.  It tasted like coffee but, for me, it was just so-so... nothing to get excited about.  There again, I'll take the blame -- I probably had too much water.  That's why I picked 3 stars or ""middle of the road.""  If I have an opportunity to try it again with the right amount of coffee grounds for the water, I will surely update this review.  I hope they will indicate on their future packages how much water is recommended.",Neutral
"Yesterday's mail brought from amazon.com's VINE program a free 3-ounce sample of PUROAST LOW ACID COFFEE, Dark French Roast.<br /><br />My wife and I tried it before, during and after breakfast this morning (2 mugs apiece so far).<br /><br />-- (1) How I prepared the coffee drink.<br /><br />My wife and I had had a late dinner yesterday evening at the monthly meeting of Asheville-Blue Ridge Torch Club in a first class local Hotel. In my case my main course was a stew based around a fatty cut of short ribs of beef. When I woke this morning, I fet mild stomach discomfort, and first reached for a GAVISCON-brand  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QR76"">Gaviscon Extra Strength Chewable Antacid Tablets, Original Flavor, 100-Count Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> stomach soother. An hour our so later my wife and I began sampling the PUROAST Low Acid Coffee. I prepared the drink  in in our MR COFFEE-brand drip coffee maker. I decided to do it exactly as I normally do with FOLGER's or other brands, aiming at ten cups of coffee based on three scoops of the ground beans. Those three scoops used up about 3/5 of the contents of our free sample. I will try the rest tomorrow.<br /><br /> And here are the agreed opinions of us both:<br /><br />-- (2) PUROAST coffee felt very soothing in the stomach - immediately. Here was something better than any other coffee we had ever tried. Here, a couple of hours later, I am still grateful for a sense that PUROAST soothed my agitated innards. This is a quality to build the brand around, no doubt.<br /><br />-- (3) Neither wife nor I found the taste pleasant. It was far from vile. We didn't feel compelled to stop drinking. As I write, I am still sipping my second mug. I am no expert on evaluating coffees, but if I put my mind to it I could probably describe five different flavor sensations. My wife and I discussed our sensations.<br /><br />First, I asked her: ""Does this remind you of POSTUM <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DGQK1Y"">1904 Vintage Ad Postum Coffee Substitute Caffeine Free - Original Print Ad</a>? -- a drink I don't like. She: POSTUM tastes better. To me the underlying flavor reminds of POSTUM, a very STRONG POSTUM.<br /><br />Second, it tasted bitter in the mouth, though felt soothing in the stomach.<br /><br />Third, something reminds of wood shaving being turned into charcoal.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: My wife and I are both tempted to explore further the concept of ""low acid coffee"" and to order other varieties from the company's website:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />We are keeping an open mind. In my case I hope to find another blend that reminds me a bit more of coffee and a bit less of POSTUM.<br /><br />-OOO-",Neutral
"Puroast low acid coffee does what it says it will do, allow folks with certain stomach sensitivities to enjoy coffee without hearburn.  The 3 oz packet produces a very strong pot of coffee, and therefore some folks may want to experiment with using a partial packet to brew the perfect pot.  But the coffee had a full-bodied flavor and did not leave any bitter aftertaste.  I would compare the taste to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0TW"">Melitta European Roast Extra Dark Ground Coffee, 10.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />The problem is that while the coffee itself is good, it is rather overpriced.  As it stands, you are looking at spending over $2 a pot if you buy the ten-pack.  Particularly in light of the fact that some folks will waste a pack or two trying to adjust to suit their tastes.  I can buy four or five full size cans of the Melitta coffee for the price of this brand.  Because of the price, the coffee is not a good value for your buck.",Neutral
"Low acid or not, I'm sorry, I just couldn't get past the taste. I tried it black and w/ additives - sugar, coffee-mate, etc..I had to draw the line at artificial sweeteners; they make everything taste worse...

Well, it looks like I'm stuck w/ decaf during the work week until someone finds a low acid, great tasting coffee...",Neutral
"Tastes like coffee. A nice mild roast, which will not be to the tastes of those who want a bolder, maybe near burnt taste like Starbucks.<br /><br />And this is very easy on the stomach. Of course that is because of they way it is ground, this is a very fine grind and quite frankly any fine ground coffee (even Espresso) is going to be easier and way less acidic and easy on your digestive system then a rougher grind.",Neutral
"Since I love French Roast, I was happy to get a sample of this particular roast. I opened the sealed bag and smelled the contents, which were not as robust-smelling as the French Roast I have been used to. I brewed a cup, and tasted it:<br /><br />1) Black no sugar -- rubbery after-taste<br />2) Black, with sugar -- mitigated the rubbery after-taste which was still there<br />3) Cream and sugar -- removed the rubbery after-taste, was pleasant and smooth but not as rich and aromatic as the French Roast I am used to.<br /><br />After four cups (not in the same day) my stomach WAS happier than when on ""normal"" coffee - I determined that the rubbery after-taste was there to stay. However, the coffee WAS smooth and definitely not acidic. But, it's a sad trade-off: low acid, rubbery taste (unless you mask it with cream/soy and sugar/honey). Hopefully something can be done to ""tweak"" those ""settings"".",Neutral
"I was never much of a coffee drinker in college, and it was only when I moved out on my own, in graduate school, that I started to enjoy a good cup of coffee.  When I got my first real full time job, I would easily drink a pot of coffee every day.  However, as someone with a lot of gastrointestinal issues, coffee is a huge dietary sin.  The caffeine and acid could do me, and spur stomach aches that would last for days.  When I was officially diagnosed with acid reflux, my doctor told me to cut all caffeine out of my diet, cold turkey, until things were under control.<br /><br />Now that I have learned how to control my gastro issues, I am once again worshipping at the shrine of the coffee bean.  Since I began working again, I make a small pot daily.  But I quickly find myself feeling icky from drinking coffee.  So when I learned about Puroast Low Acid Coffee, I was thrilled.  It caters to people who have acid issues but love coffee.  I was thrilled to get to try it.<br /><br />My first impression was WOAH, this coffee is strong.  I am not a huge fan of french roast coffee, I tend to like a milder blend.  Once I got over the initial taste, and adjusted my milk and Splenda accordingly, I started to really enjoy this coffee.  While it was fresh and hot, it was pretty delicious.<br /><br />The problem with this coffee is when I returned to the pot for a second cup.  This was probably within 20-30 minutes of brewing, and the heating unit was still on.  But the coffee did not taste fresh at all; it almost tasted as if I had reheated coffee from yesterday.  It actually tasted more acidic that my normal coffee does.  So, I had to throw the rest of the pot out.  Because of this, I just cannot tell if this coffee really does allow someone with acid issues to enjoy a pot of coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the french roast blend; another blend may have better results.  I would certainly try another flavor, because as I said, the initial cup was fantastic.  If this could be purchased as a resealable container, I may be more likely to purchase it, and make only a cup or two at a time, so as not to waste it.  I am not ready to give up on this product just yet.",Neutral
"I love Folgers ""Smooth"" coffee because of its low acidity and ease on the stomach, so I was anxious to try Puroast Low Acid Coffee for a different flavor and to mix it up a bit in the morning.  Sadly, I was not impressed.<br /><br />While the coffee does have a robust flavor that definitely taps the tongue right at the first sip, I can't say it's a really good strong coffee flavor that I'd enjoy sipping.  It actually tasted weak by the second sip and after a while it just tasted old and bitter.<br /><br />I tried fixing it up with things like sugar or Splenda but got the same outcome.  By the second cup, I tried a shot of Baileys and it still just had a bland flavor after the first sip.<br /><br />I'll stick to my Folgers ""Smooth"" blend for now.  It's cheaper, not bitter, and keeps a constant flavor throughout that is quite pleasing.",Neutral
"To be fair, I have to say that French Roast is not my favorite roast of coffee.  I never buy it in any brand.  If the sample sent to me had been a medium roast I could give it a better rating, probably.  Part of the joy of the experience of drinking coffee, for me, is the smell of a freshly opened bag or can.  The fragrance of this, freshly opened, was of burnt coffee beans.  The flavor, upon making it, was of coffee made with burnt coffee beans.  But, as I say, I have this problem with any French Roast.  As far as low acidity, I think the makers are on the mark.  I'd like to try this brand in a different roast to give it a fair evaluation.",Neutral
"Do you get heartburn with coffee?  Before I started my little purple pills I did, and now I get to enjoy all the drinks and foods that used to burn my chest and torment my sleep.<br /><br />I was intrigued when I saw this product with the description: ""Puroast Low Acid Coffee introduces our great taste, low acid coffee in a single pot, 3 oz. size which is great for the office, home, or travel. Puroast Low Acid Coffee offers consumers who a great tasting, smooth coffee that is proven to give symtpom (sic) relief to consumers who suffer from heartburn, reflux, and other related conditions.""<br /><br />I got a pack, and it wasn't bad coffee, and I didn't get heartburn, but I haven't had it in years since I started the medicine.<br /><br />Alas - I also had a medical school education which allowed me to know that ""stomach acid"" is not only a real thing, but its hydrochloric acid, literally about the strongest acid possible.  One of the amazing things about human physiology is that our stomachs are designed to successfully hold that caustic solution.  Our esophagus is not, and when the sphincter between the stomach and throat is weak - even momentarily - the stomach acid splashes up into our esophagus and causes the familiar ""heartburn.""<br />Methylxanthines are common substances that will relax the sphincters in our body, and they're found in high quantities in caffeine and chocolates, for example.  So - how useful is a ""low acid coffee"" in preventing the actual cause of heartburn if it has the desirable caffeine?<br /><br />I wrote the Puroast people and pointed out these things and they wrote me back with links to research done by biochemists on coffees.  I was still scratching my head over what to write in my review when I got an email from the CEO of Puroast! Yeah, I was surprised!  Anyway, he wrote:<br /><br /> ""Puroast does not make a claim as to the correlation between the pH<br />of its coffee and the causes of heartburn/reflux, only that the coffee has<br />significantly lower acid content (up to 80% lower) than leading commercial<br />brands.""<br /><br />So - ""Puroast Low Acid Coffee offers consumers who a great tasting, smooth coffee that is proven to give symtpom (sic) relief to consumers who suffer from heartburn, reflux, and other related conditions."" - isn't a claim that there is a correlation between the ph of its coffee and the causes of heartburn?  Am I being trivial to point out that their product description misspells ""symptom"" and that the package I received misspelled ""gourmet?"")<br /><br />So - is it good coffee?  It ain't bad.  It's absolutely worth drinking on the basis of its flavor alone.  But is it worth >15 bucks for 10 one-pot bags?  I'd try the larger bags first.  Or I'd keep taking my purple pills and keep drinking the coffee that tastes best to me.",Neutral

"I do not suffer from heart-burn or other stomach ills that are related to acidity of my food. I am an average coffee drinker.  I don't have to drink decaffinated coffee, and I don't make a point of drinking only gourmet coffee either.<br /><br />This coffee claims to be the answer for the needs of those who are acid-sensitive.  I can see why, because I can taste the low acidity.  It adds a certain degree of smoothness and drinkability.  The aroma is good, it is inviting, and the after taste is quite pleasent.  Even though I don't have to drink low-acid coffee, I could drink this coffee daily, and I could be content.<br /><br />Then, there is the other side of the coin.  If you are a true gourmet coffee drinker, you probably will be very disappointed with this one.  If you are happy with the ""house-blend"" at ""Starbucks"", you will likely be happy with this one too.  If you only drink some of the specialty brands of coffee from ""Peets"", then you should not even consider buying this one.<br /><br />Finally there is the price.  I am accustomed to pay this kind of price for top of the line gourmet coffee, but I consider it on the high side for this kind of product.",Neutral
"I was under the impression I was getting 10 packages of the puroast low acid coffee to try but only got one.

"I often get a sour stomach from drinking coffee, so I thought I'd give Puroast a try.<br /><br />Just as methods of decaffeination often affect the taste of coffee, so does whatever technique they used to reduce the acidity.<br /><br />It's a shame, because the fresh grounds had a wonderful aroma, but the brewed coffee had a bitterness beyond what I normally associated with acidity. As a result, the flavor didn't have much dimension.<br /><br />On the plus side, there were no negative stomach effects, so I suppose if I wanted the caffeine and wanted to avoid the possibility of a sour stomach, this would be a reasonable alternative. That's an unlikely scenario, though.",Neutral
"I usually drink Gevalia medium roast or Dunkin' Donuts brand coffee. I have a 4 cup coffee maker and I use about 2 tablespoons of coffee per 4 cup pot.<br /><br />I used slightly less with this Puroast coffee because it's a French roast but even using slightly less, it was just too dark tasting for me. The second pot I made, I used even less - maybe a scant tablespoon and a half and it was still not for me. Even adding a good sized dollop of fat free half and half didn't make me want to finish the cup.<br /><br />However, I have lots of relatives and friends who like their coffee VERY ""full bodied"" and I think they'd like this. I just ordered some logo imprinted, insulated travel coffee mugs for my husband's business and I'm strongly considering ordering some of this to include with the mugs at Christmas time when we give them out to those my hubs has done business with.<br /><br />I see this brand comes in lighter roasts and I wouldn't mind having some of that on hand for friends/relatives who come to visit who I know have acid reflux/heartburn issues. For myself though, I think I'll stick to my favorites.",Neutral
"A little burnt, moreso than I like French Roast, I would put this more in the dark-Italian roast range. On the back side of flavor without much roundness, there is a little less body than perfect.

"For those who normally steep a few Rolaids or Tums in their mug of Joe, a low-acid coffee seems an ideal alternative to those upset tummies. Puroast Low Acid French Roast is one such alternative, but there is a definite trade-off. The coffee is certainly low on acid, leaving me feeling well after a cup or two. But, the Puroast lacks that robust bitterness that regular coffee has, making it less rewarding on the palate. It's not that the flavor is undesirable -- in fact, it tastes just fine; it just isn't as rich, due to the process of removing the acidity (?).<br /><br />Overall, Puroast will certainly due in a pinch, and is great for those who suffer major acid indigestion from consuming regular coffee. But if you can tolerate a little discomfort and don't mind taking Pepto, you may wish to stick with your grande latte from Starbucks.",Neutral
"Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast, sounds delightful for those of us who need to reduce acid in our diets.  I made a pot this morning, very excited to try this new product but found it is a little on the bitter side, and has a slightly over-roasted flavor.  I had to add extra cream to cut the bitterness, and don't think I could ever drink this black.  For those coffee drinkers who like a very dark roast, this may be just the coffee for you, but for myself, I believe I will pass on this one.  Puroast Low Acid Coffee is a really great concept, just not for this coffee drinker.",Neutral
"I don't really fit the presumed target audience, i.e., those with medical conditions that require low-acid diets. But, I dislike the sour taste of coffees with higher acidity, so I tried this with high hopes.<br /><br />It brews up a little strong (I used my preferred ratio). The taste was unspectacular, which isn't to say it was bad. It tasted like the diner coffee I used to love back when true diners were more prevalent. No toasty/nutty flavors. No complex aromas. Just honest coffee.<br /><br />So, I was not disappointed, but I wasn't impressed. For the price, I'll stick to Cafe Altura. I haven't tested the pH, but Altura is rich, strong, smooth, and best of all, consistently NOT sour.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Give it a shot, but temper your expectations.",Neutral
"We got this coffee for my wife, who is nearing the end of her pregnancy and is slowly starting to resume coffee drinking. As someone who will be giving birth in a month, she was starting to experience minor heartburn.<br /><br />As far as the heartburn goes, this coffee made no difference in the positive or negative directions. So we're just rating it as coffee, not as a lower-acid alternative. As coffee, it was pretty average, with a mild, wimpy sort of taste. It wasn't unpalatable by any means, it was just sort of ho-hum.<br /><br />This might be worth a try if you have serious issues with reflux or acid in your diet. But it's a pretty bland cup of coffee, all told.",Neutral
"Normally, if it's got the word ""gourmet"" in it, my back stiffens up. It's a label often slapped onto an over priced product to attract the those that will eat/drink anything with the word on ""gourmet"" because they think it makes them look cool and hip. And it usually doesn't taste what I would consider ""gourmet."" So, I confess, I started reviewing this with a bias against it - high price and labeled ""gourmet"".<br /><br />With only a ""one pot"" sample to work with, I didn't have a chance to try differing brewing methods. I went with my typical coffee making method, drip brew. It smelled nice, looked pretty dark. The taste is very hard to explain. While it has a full flavor, that flavor is of...weak coffee. I thought I'd botched the brew, but when I compared the color and opacity against my normal stuff, the Puroast looked identical. It just tasted like the same near see through stuff one gets at a greasy spoon restaurant, gas station,IHOP, etc. While not vile, it wasn't for me. I prefer a darker, richer taste.<br /><br />That being said, the big deal about Puroast is that it's low acid. That I will say I definitely noticed. Not even a hint of tummy twisting, even though I intentionally drank it on an empty stomach. For those that have problems with acid, and don't mind (or maybe even like) the taste of weak coffee, it's worth a try at least.

The consensus was that Dan found it a little weak, Harry could really tell there was less acid in it and Gayle gave it 5 stars because it didn't ""bowl her over"" with harsh flavor.<br /><br />As for me, I loved the smoothness of the brew best of all. I did find it on the weak side after the initial velvety taste went over the tongue. The flavor was rather bland. There was no over-all deep, full-bodied taste, but with the beans adjusted to exclude acidity, I didn't think there would be.<br /><br />I would drink it again, but probably wouldn't buy it.

"I admit I am not a coffee expert by any means.  Basically, if it is brown, hot, and has cream and sugar I can drink it.  Usually.  That being said, the Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast was okay -- the taste to me was very strong and I am thankful that I didn't use the entire packet for the pot of coffee I made.  I would have never been able to drink it it was so strong.  That's the part where I am unsure of -- I am definitely not a fan of strong coffee.  The fact that it is titled as ""low acid"" didn't meant very much to me but I didn't have heartburn.  But I usually don't when drinking coffee.<br /><br />The price of this coffee alone would deter me from impulse buying or even buying it to try.  It comes in a pack of ten for twenty-four dollars and even if I only used half a packet, that would still only give me enough coffee for less than a month.

The aroma of the coffee after brewing was fine, but I felt that it tasted strong like a certain brand from Seattle.  And I don't like their coffee. For a dark French roast it tasted burnt to me.  On the other hand, my wife enjoyed it (and she is big fan of DD coffee).  I guess it goes to what each individual's taste is but to me this wasn't my cup of tea (pun intended).",Neutral

"I'll give you three different thoughts on this coffee:<br /><br />1. As a coffee: it's not the world's best cup of coffee. If you're not dealing with the acid issues, you won't find this worth getting for the flavor. The package I had was not bad. It was ok. When I brew coffee, though, I'm looking for a little better than ok.<br /><br />2. As a value: I'm not sure this is good in terms of value. First of all, I typically make coffee in a 4-cup mini brewer, so I only need about half the package size here. Second, most of the time the extra packaging for single-serve raises the cost a little bit. So, it's not a real good value.<br /><br />3. As coffee for someone with heartburn: Here's the kicker: Puroast doesn't claim it's the best coffee in the world. It claims to be a coffee that is processed in a way to reduce acid effects from drinking it. To my senses, it does just that. (They claim to have published research that supports it, so trace their links for science.) Usually I don't drink coffee in the evenings because the acid feel just churns through the night. Not so with the Puroast. It performed for me just as advertised.<br /><br />So: the flavor's not exceptional, but that's what sugar, flavored creamers, or other add-ins can help address. The value's not great, but it is cheaper than a trip to Starbucks. And if you can't have the full-acid of a normal coffee, this one is worth a try.",Neutral
"In order to taste test this coffee, I used the sample to make a pot.  I used freshly filtered water and a Melitta drip cone with a Melitta filter.  I invited two other coffee lovers to join me in trying the brewed coffee.  Each of us agreed that this dark roast coffee was mild, did have the ""bitter"" taste that one associates with dark roast coffee, but was weak in flavor.  Whether or not that is a result of removing the acid, I can only leave to the chemists to decide.  For one who needs to avoid acid, I believe this is a good choice.  But, if you really love the flavor of good coffee, then you may want to consider other options.",Neutral
"Let me begin by explaining where my palate is coming from. My usual coffee is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y2QTTI"">Community Coffee Ground Coffee, French Roast, 32-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)</a>. I'd actually prefer to drink <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5O4G"">Starbucks French Roast Coffee (Extra Bold), Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a>, but I just can't afford it. So, I like French roast, which has a darker, bolder flavor, and I thought I'd give this coffee a try.<br /><br />I would rate the flavor of this coffee as middling. It didn't have that paint-thinner flavor that cheap coffees have (I'm looking at you Folgers). But it also didn't have the depth and richness that I associate with high-quality French roasts. Not a lot of body in this coffee (body is that heaviness on the tongue). Most French roasts have much more body, but some people might prefer this coffee because it has less. Taste-wise, this coffee is also fairly low in acidity (which you would expect from the brand), but low acidity is characteristic of most French roasts. I don't know how much easier this will be on the sensitive stomach.<br /><br />My guess is that if your stomach has serious acid problems, then this coffee will still be too much for it. If you just get a little sour stomach, you might be able to handle some other brands, and trial and error should lead you to the right one. I hesitate to recommend this coffee because of the price. You're paying a premium price for a middling flavor. I think most people  with acid sensitivity should be able to find a better coffee they can stomach for the same price or a much cheaper option with the same flavor. But, if you try this coffee and it works for you, enjoy. It's not a bad coffee; I just didn't find its flavor outstanding.",Neutral
"I have occasional problems with heartburn, so when I saw that Puroast had released a coffee specially designed to be low acid, I was eager to try it, and I enlisted my husband as a willing co-investigator.  Our verdict:  The coffee does indeed have a noticeably smoother, less acidy taste.  That's the good part.  However, I would characterize the taste--and I'm trying to be diplomatic here--as reminiscent of a slightly old coffee foil pack found in a three star hotel.  I'll admit to being somewhat of a Starbucks addict, and I don't think the Puroast will convince me to change.  However, I think it would be a good option to have on hand for times when my stomach is acting up but I still need my morning caffeine fix, and if my stomach forced me to where I had to choose between the Puroast low acid coffee or no coffee at all, I'd gratefully drink the Puroast.",Neutral
I cannot say I had high expectations for a low-acid French roast coffee.  It was rather bland so the flavor does not live up to the full-bodied flavor one would expect from a dark roast coffee.

To me, the smell of the coffee brewing is almost as good as drinking it. There just wasn't much of an aroma while brewing or after pouring in the cup. I added cream and the taste was ok.

Keep that in mind if you also drink your coffee strong: the 3 ounce packets are small.<br /><br />I am a Folgers fan.  It has a full-bodied flavor that is rich and satisfying to me.  So I am comparing Puroast Low Acid Coffee to Folgers, and the Puroast Low Acid Coffee failed miserably.  I found Puroast coffee thin and weak with some bitterness.  There is a mild espresso flavor that is similar to Turkish coffee I have had.  Bitter and unpleasant, but weak at the same time.<br /><br />I have had acid reflux (GERD) in the past and drinking regular coffee does exacerbate the condition.  This low acid coffee is made for people with acid reflux conditions so severe that they have had to stop drinking their morning coffee, and I applaud the fact that any coffee company has addressed the issue.  At the same time, the price is prohibitive.  10 tiny 3 ounce bags for $24?  If you make one pot every morning, that $72 a month!  For that cost, I would suggest buying acid reducer pills, and taking one before you drink your morning coffee, and to try to eat something bland while drinking your coffee, to give your stomach something to do with all the acid it is creating.<br /><br />Or, if you only have acid reflux in the morning and you think it's the coffee you are drinking, be aware that it could be caused by some medications you are taking, like calcium or vitamin pills.  In fact, any large pill can sit in your stomach and cause your stomach to create a lot of acid trying to break it down.  A recommendation is to either take more frequent smaller doses of the vitamin supplement, or stop them all together and cut out the acid reflux entirely.  Or add acid reducer medication and put up with it.<br /><br />Two or three sips of this Puroast Low Acid Coffee and it's down the drain.  It's giving me acid reflux just talking about it.",Neutral
"this coffee was made in a drip filter - i have to say that while the taste was not objectionable, it was not memorable... as far as the 'low acid' feature, i've never been affected by the acidity of coffee, and could not detect a lack of acidity in this brew...",Neutral
"I obtained a sample and when I opened the package the aroma was not inviting at all.  Well, I brewed it up anyway on a regular Cuisinart coffee maker and used the sample bag with enough water for 2-3 cups to make a stronger cup of coffee. Nevertheless, it tasted weak to me and didn't smell any better after brewing it. It was drinkable and ok, just not very satisfying to me as it didn't have a richness or depth or good aroma to it. Admittedly, I am not a big French Roast fan as it tends to taste bitter to me and acidic.  This one may be better than other French Roast because while I thought it tasted weak and bitter it presumably is lower acid. If you need a low acid coffee, then this is okay, but if not you may not find this satisfying, especially if you like dark, full flavored strong coffee.",Neutral
"First off, I am a Dunkin Donuts coffee guy.  I like it the best out of major brands, either from the local franchise (cream and sugar) or made at home (black).  Dunkin Donuts' coffee is not for everyone, as it has a heavily roasted taste.  At work, we purchase Starbucks Sumatra from the local coffee delivery distributor (it's actually cheaper than DD or other brands!).  Starbucks House Blend used to be what we bought, but everyone in the office (myself included) felt it was one of the most acidic coffees to drink.  Their Sumatra is stronger but less acidic.  I'm no coffee expert, but the last couple years has definitely opened my eyes to the nuances of coffee flavor.  With that experience, I was interested to try this product.<br /><br />The flavor, off the bat, is certainly less acidic.  I drank it black, as I don't typically add anything to my coffee.  It has a fuller coffee taste than many decafs I've tried, but there is a bit of a dull taste to it.  I made it at home, and have a very clean coffee maker, but it was just a little off.  I prefer it to Dunkin decaf, but not by much.  If you require a non-decaf coffee with low acid, this is a fine choice.  It may improve with sugar or creamer too.  There may be better choices out there for this type of product, or coffees which are full flavor but less acidic.  I am not extremely sensitive to the acid content in coffee, but if you are, this should be a good choice for you.",Neutral
"I normally drink Foldger's (sp) coffee and not much of that.  My regular coffee is definately strong in the acid department, at least for me.<br /><br />This coffee has no acid as far as I am concerned.  It had no acid aftertaste and did not impact my stomach at all.  As far as the taste I liked it less than my normal coffee.  It is stronger than Foldger's  (sp).  I would have given the coffee another star but my wife couldn't stand the taste so I figured it had to come down at least one star because of her complete disapproval.<br /><br />So I give this coffee 3 stars overall and 5 stars for lack of acid problems.<br /><br />AD2",Neutral
"This coffee has a taste I can't identify, nor describe, but I wouldn't buy this coffee again.  Perhaps if I had to use low acid coffee I'd buy more.<br /><br />I added cream (something I don't usually use) and sugar and it wasn't that bad, but I'd rather have a coffee I can drink black - the way I like it.",Neutral
"This wasn't quite what I expected.  The coffee wasn't as strong as I like it even when I used 2 bags.

I could understand if the acid in coffee brothers you but for the 2 cup a morning mama I'm keeping my regular brand.",Neutral
More like a slightly darker-roast version of standard office coffee. Thin body; not a true French roast flavor. It did seem to be less acidic.,Neutral
While I wanted to try this coffee because of an acid reflex difficulty I was having for me personally it did not taste at  all like what I would call real coffee.<br /><br />I've been used to drnking either Starburcks or Petts which I think have what you might call a robust flavor.  That may be the reason I was disappointed in this.,Neutral
Taste is OK.  But I still prefer my cold brewed coffee's flavor.  Plus the cold brewed coffee has a lot less acid.  Costs a lot more than regular too.,Neutral
"I like low acid coffees for the reduced bitterness, as I dont general have acid-induced stomach problems. This coffee was very smooth and had little to no bitter taste - great features of a dark roast.  However, the flavor was not as deep or rich as I would expect from a gourmet French roast. It was pleasant, but I prefer a slightly more robust, complex flavor in a dark roast.",Neutral
I'm a big coffee drinker...so the low acid is really a good idea.  This product was good...somewhere in the middle between Folgers and Starbucks I think. I can't say it was so good that I want to only drink his brand...but it will be remembered as one of many good coffees I've had.,Neutral

"I was interested in trying this low-acid coffee, as I sometimes have difficulties with ""regular"" coffee. Brewed up a pot in my drip coffee maker, and gave it a try.<br /><br />It was OK -- decent flavor, comparable to my local grocer's ""upscale"" store brand. I tried a cup black, and a second cup like I usually drnk my coffee, with ""pink packet"" sweetener and a splash of creamer. I could tell it was low acid -- the negative effects I sometimes get didn't happen; not even a hint of stomach upset.<br /><br />But I'm not sure it's good enough to warrant the much higher cost.  I wanted to be wowed by it, and I wasn't.  Your mileage may vary, of course, as coffee is a rather personal taste.",Neutral
"Maybe they just had the roaster a little too hot that day, but our beans were slightly burnt. That being said, I can see (taste) the blend's potential. I'm no connoisseur, but I have my preferences. This blend was ok...not good, not great, just okay.",Neutral
"This coffee is really, really delicious, quality-tasting and fresh, but it does NOT wake me up.  Doesn't seem to have much caffeine.  If I drink some in the afternoon before work, I notice no difference in energy.  I just found out today that there is actually more caffeine in light roast coffee, so I'm gonna get Starbucks Breakfast Blend.",Neutral
"BEWARE!! As usual everything about the deal went great because of Amazon; prompt delivery, etc., etc. However, this coffee will expire in less then 3 months. So, clearly, this has been sitting around somewhere. I buy other Kirkland coffee's at my local Costco and they usually don't expire for 12 to 18 months. Unfortunately, the Kirkland Espresso hasn't made it to the East Coast (last year or so far this year), at least not at the Costco's around me, and I wanted to try it, since, even at this inflated price it's priced about the same as 2 pounds of Lavazza, etc.<br /><br />So, hopefully it will be fine when I open it, but don't buy this expecting to use it this winter!",Neutral
"Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former ""Fresh Mixers"" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to ""Lunch Express,"" apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction.",Neutral

Both of my dogs love them, but they can eat one in about 30 seconds, defeating the purpose of a chew type treat. For the price, I'd rather just buy them regular dog biscuits that are eaten in the same amount of time. That being said, the Amazon price is MUCH cheaper than any in store local price I've seen. Maybe these are better for small dogs that can't devour them so quickly, but my 70 pounders eat them like they are a regular old dog biscuit.",Neutral

"I remember the Shake n Bake from a long time ago! I had tried the chicken in the past but not the pork. When I saw this offer I decided to give it a try since I had pork chops in the freezer. Well, I wasn't as impressed with it as I am with the chicken one. It just didn't have as good a flavor. I supposed you could add extra spices to it but I wanted to try it ""as is"". You can't beat the ease of the Shake n Bake products! Love that aspect. But, unfortunately, this pork one just wasn't my families favorite. But don't let my review keep you from trying it. Your taste buds might be different from ours!",Neutral
"This was definitely easy (read recommended for bachelors, single dad's, or those otherwise cooking-impaired) though because my chops were thick it took almost twice as long too cook. Also, I'm not sure if it was again the size of the chops or their proximity in the pan, but the end product looked more like a kind of mushy batter than the crisp-looking, bread-like substance shown in the picture on the cover of the package.<br /><br />It did taste good, but not so good that a little BBQ sauce wasn't needed to zing it up. But then again I'll use any excuse I can find to consume BBQ sauce.<br /><br />Bottom line - the kids loved it, me and the gf liked it. So it falls somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.",Neutral
"Pork has a tendency to dry out during cooking, and Shake N Bake does a very good job keeping all the juices sealed into the meat. Toss your chops in a plastic bag with a packet of Shake N Bake until coated, pop them in the oven and 15 minutes later, you have juicy pork chops with a satisfying crunch you can usually only get from frying.<br /><br />Shake N Bake would be the perfect pork enhancing product if it has a little more taste to it. The ingredients name dried onions, extractives (?) of paprika, and the very descriptive term - spice. I don't know could possibly be included in this secret spice because a Shake N Bake pork chop tastes very close to a regular pork chop with a plain breadcrumb coating.<br /><br />Shake N Bake is quick, easy to use and results in a decent, albeit bland, piece of pork. Good for kids and picky eaters. For those looking juicy pork chops with more zest, I'd suggest <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002QYJDNS"">McCormick Bag 'n Season Pork Chops, 1.06oz (Pack of 10)</a>.",Neutral
"Honestly -- I do prefer my own recipe (which is to use an egg batter, breading and hot oil and butter in a pan).<br /><br />But we (spouse and self) just tried this product and we consumed a lot less fat and calories using Shake'N Bake. My husband's first words were: ""Oh, this is good!"" And then, the more he ate, the more he thought he ""tasted vegetables."" By the time he finished, he said, ""It was okay."" My first (and lasting) impression was that I tasted, along with the pork chop, a hint of thyme and paprika and not much else.<br /><br />Shake'N Bake adds 40 calories per chop, but my recipe would have added more than that (egg dip plus breadcrumbs). Plus if each chop would absorb 3 tablespoons of oil, another 360 calories (and 42g of fat) per chop would be added. We're always looking for ways to remove calories and fat from our meals. From that perspective, I really like this product! (Isn't there always a trade off between additives, calories, fat, carbs and how something tastes?)<br /><br />I also thought Shake'N Bake was a lot less messy and much more convenient than my recipe. (There was no runny egg-wash dish to rinse out, no sticky breadcrumb mess to clean up and no greasy frying pan or grease splatter.) After shaking the pork, I simply threw away the plastic bag. (I supplied my own ziplock bag.)<br /><br />I had enough coating for six boneless pork chops. After coating each chop, I shook it a little and placed it in an ungreased baking dish.

"To the horror of foodies everywhere, Shake and Bake looks like it's trying to make a comeback. Well, the concept is good, but the flavor just isn't quite there.<br />I do like this cooking method for pork. I grew up in house where pork had to be cooked to death because ""you could get trichinosis."" Well now you don't have to cook pork forever anymore.<br />Anyway, the amount of S&B powder in the packet was not enough to cover 6 thin pork chops. I took two 4-inch diameter, 1-inch thick boneless chops and pounded them to about 1/2 inch thick. Then I cut those in half. The S&B barely covered those four pieces. I cooked it according to directions and then checked them with a meat thermometer. One had to go back in for a few minutes.<br />My results looked very little like the picture on the package. I'm thinking the ""serving suggestion"" photo was one chop with an entire packet of S&B packed on to it and fluffed up for the photo. The powder itself is that color, it doesn't develop it in the oven.<br />We had to liberally douse the meat with ketchup or Japanese tonkatsu sauce. You really do need to serve something with it that has some flavor.<br />SOOO, I won't ever buy it. But I might try making something similar with panko crumbs and some seasonings using their cooking method.",Neutral
"I received a pack of this mix to try.  While I found the cooking time accurate, there was a flavor disappointment.  The chops came out very juicy, which was great.  I guess my biggest gripe is that the flavoring seemed so subtle because there wasn't enough on each chop.  I think the package amount should either increase, or the number of pork chops should be reduced to about four per package.  It seemed to me that the flavor was good when I scraped it together, but it definitely was too thin on each piece when the directions were followed.

"There are few dinners easier and more satisfying than a coated pork chop.  For those that don't want the hassle and calories of frying, Shake N Bake and similar coatings have been a staple for years.  Just an egg wash, coat it with the mix and bake.  Its just that easy and just that good.<br /><br />However, after trying both, I would still have to give the nod to Oven Fry extra crispy pork coating.  The SNB is a finer more powdery texture whereas the Oven Fry gives it a thicker more flavorful crust that keep juices in better.  Oven Fry gets a five from me, SNB only a three.  But either way you go, its better than a naked chop.",Neutral
"We used to use Shake 'n Bake more often a few years ago, and I was curious as to why SnB was being offered for review. Had it changed or improved? By all appearances, no, but it had new packaging. Still, I ordered it and followed the package directions very carefully, maybe using only a slightly thinner cut of chop than pictured on the packaging.<br /><br />What came out of the oven was what we always had after using SnB: A chop with good flavor, but kind of mushy breading. The only place where the breading crisped up was around fat. But, considering that this is how SnB always worked for us before, I wasn't surprised.<br /><br />The spices used in the mix are the same as the past, and they flavor a chop well. The mushy breading isn't a big deal - what matters to us is how the food tastes. Boneless pork chops need a lot of help in the flavor department and Shake 'n Bake is one quick and cheap way to dress them up. Three stars means SnB isn't bad, but it's not a taste revelation, either.",Neutral
"I have never tried any of the Shake N Bake products before.  I was mainly attracted to it because most breadings made from scratch require egg or milk and some sort of crumb, and I don't always have those ingredients on hand.  The Shake N Bake for pork only requires a bit of water to dampen the chops and the contents of the pouch -- couldn't be easier.<br /><br />I used some very inexpensive ""special purchase"" chops; they were thin but huge, not the conventional center or loin cuts, and one of them was more than enough for dinner.<br /><br />I was only making three big chops, so instead of putting the mix in a zip bag, I just poured some of the mix on a plate and dipped the chops in.  Very easy.  There was plenty of mix left, so it was a very economical meal.<br /><br />As for the flavor, well, it was okay, not bad but not great.  We specifically tasted paprika and onion powder.  I would prefer flavors that blend a bit better.<br /><br />The cheap chops came out very juicy and tender with the Shake N Bake.<br /><br />The covering was also a bit unexpected.  It is very fine and a bit grainy, not a bread crumb texture.<br /><br />We microwaved the leftovers the next day, and I would not recommend doing that because they got soggy.  The chops probably should have been warmed up in a toaster oven or maybe a skillet on low heat.",Neutral
"Well, it doesn't get easier than this.  Put boneless pork chops in a zip lock bag, pour in contents, and shake away.  Now bake for 15 minutes.<br /><br />Although the taste improves compared to simply baking the pork chops with nothing on them, the improvement isn't significant.  I'm looking for a little more flavor here, but Shake 'N Bake is a bit on the boring side.  If I had to do it over again, I'd probably add some other spices to the mix or on the chop afterwards.  I'm getting used to Thai, Indian, Mexican, etc. food so this Shake 'N Bake just isn't cutting it.  I've found very flavorful spice packets for cheaper than this, so price cannot be an good excuse.<br /><br />Again, Shake 'N Bake helps improve the taste, but then again so does basic salt and pepper.  I think these packets are personally worth about 50 cents to me.",Neutral
"Of course, reviewing something for taste is about as subjective as it gets-- but I can only say that this wasn't my favorite. I normally use breadcrumbs and fry pork on the stove, but I liked giving baking a try. The flavor of the pork worked out just fine, but I wasn't crazy about the Shake 'N' Bake seasonings. I prefer my old breadcrumbs.<br /><br />You can just put the seasonings in a Ziploc bag and shake them on as suggested, or just put the seasonings into a dish and coat the pork that way. It's certainly simple enough either way, a healthier alternative to frying, and doesn't require a lot of clean-up. Three people ate this and all gave sort of a mild thumbs-up. I wouldn't eat it again, but I liked it enough to try the chicken flavor next.",Neutral
"I've only used Shake N Bake for pork a few times in the past and decided to let my youngest (he's 10) give this a try.  While I supervised, he did all the work which to say isn't too hard.  It didn't come with a bag so we used a ziplock 1 gallon size. The product is simple to use and a quick fix if you're looking for something that requires little prep work.<br /><br />The taste is the same as I remember and would have preferred something a little spicier and not so heavily coated.  The pork was fairly tender but the coating does make it a bit messy. I thought it was okay but doubt I'll get it again.",Neutral
"This is an OK product for occasional use but not something that adds much to the preparation or improvement of the meal.  The pork chops were adequately crisp on the outside, moist and tender inside and the coating added a blandly salty and vaguely processed flavor.  I did not use gigantic pieces of meat and barely had enough to coat 4 chops.  It is cheaper, easier, more versatile and healthier to toss together my own ingredients for chicken or pork.",Neutral
"This is a pretty standard shake and bake with no shaking bag in the package. I used a Ziploc bag instead. The seasoning was OK; that is no clumping. I used this product with chicken breast and it baked fine and there were no soggy spots on the meat. The flavor is fine but if you are looking for  something with a bold flavor or spicy, you may consider looking for another product.",Neutral
"While I had not tried the pork variety of Shake N Bake in years, I wasn't really expecting anything too different from what I remembered. Therefore I was neither surprised nor disappointed when it was basically just as I had remembered.<br /><br />For whatever reason, the pork variety of Shake and Bake seems to have very little taste other than mildly salty.  That is why we generally use the Chicken variety of Shake N Bake on both chicken and pork, even that we tend to blend and doctor with other coatings and herbs.<br /><br />As it stands by itself it makes for a decent coating mix and if your pork is good and you like it crispy, this will do the job.",Neutral
"This was a staple in our household in my youth.  Pork was our favorite flavor, too.  Perhaps it is my aging taste buds but I felt it lacked something.  It is still a light, mild coating mix and a fast way to prepare a main dish.  Next time I use it I may add a little more spice to the mix.  I used 2 thick pork chops for this review, and will use the thinner ones next time.  They didn't get crispy enough for my preference and took longer than recommended to reach the 160 degree temp required (per the package for done).  Also, by that time they were dry, not moist inside.<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned she wished it had a resealable bag.  My Amazon-Vine-sample did not come with any bag, but I want to caution any user about saving any of the mix that has had raw meat immersed in it.  It is a health hazard to keep it and even the box indicates it should be thrown away.  I just shook a small portion of the mix into a shallow bowl and just used enough for the 2 chops.  That way I was able to save the unused portion for another day.",Neutral
"The product was recently reformulated and, IMHO, isn't as good as it was.  The box states it has black tea, honey and vanilla & spices.

It coats your tongue a bit (sort of like a fat compound that was cheaply processed). Reminds me of icing made with shortening...a slightly waxy residue remains after each swallow.<br /><br />2. The powder never fully dissolves. A big issue. And we're not talking about a slight residue. You can see the granules floating as you stir and stir and stir. When you get down to the bottom of the mug, several millimeters of powder have accumulated into a brown sludge. The only time I've been successful with getting this to fully dissolve was by bringing it to a boil and sustaining it for several minutes. Even then, there was residue at the bottom of the mug.

I hear that Illy packs their coffee in nitrogen to help preserve flavor and aroma.

So it is edible but it is way over priced and if I had only bought one can, I would never have bought more.",Neutral
"These tasted like potatoe stix, that we got in grade school with our lunches usually on pizza day.  They were the bomb then, not so much now.  Won't buy again unless I get them for cheap or free.",Neutral
"These chips are unusual and they do ""grow"" on you. The taste is most like shoestring potatoes, of which I am boderline addicted. I would order these again, but they are just too salty for my taste. I ordered the plain, so I don't know if the other flavors are also salty.",Neutral
"I love the taste of pop-chips but, I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience.<br />I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.<br /><br />I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour-cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok.",Neutral
I tried the BBQ first and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I have always had a weakness for Sour Cream & Onion so figured it would be heaven in the popchips calorie sized bags..<br /><br />And it arrived and just didn't have the same 'tang' as most SC&O flavors do.,Neutral
"I order these chips on a regular basis.  I like how they are portioned and one bag is only 2 points if you're doing Weight Watchers.  My last order however, arrived at my house in an open box with a huge amount of tape.  This resulted in me getting a case of crumbs.  I was very disappointed because usually they come in safe packaging. I give the chips 5 stars, but the packaging this time around was horrible!",Neutral
"While the chip is still light and crispy the flavor is off. It does have a nice little kick to it, but to me it tasted more like pickle than jalope&ntilde;o. I think they should be called ""pickle chips""",Neutral
"My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",Neutral
"I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.",Neutral
"I love Pop Chips and had been odering the variety pack.  However, there were some flavors in the variety pack that I didn't particularly care for, so I decided to branch out.  This is my first time trying this flavor.  While okay, they are not as good as I had originally thought.  I'm working my way through them, but will probably not order this flavor in the future.",Neutral
"These popchips both taste and smell horrible. I was very let down as I enjoy most if not all the various flavors that popchips have to offer... besides this flavor. The smell is actually so awful that it kills it from the start. If you could manage to eat them after that, well good on you. As for me I am dissatisfied with this flavor in specific. I would still recommend popchips as a whole.",Neutral
I love sweet potatoes. They are a nutritional powerhouse and great for diabetics. I eat them in a variety of dishes to stay lean and fit. I also love chips. Imagine my dismay when I thought the best of both worlds (sweet potato chips ) ended up tasting not much like either of those things. I ate three bags on different days and on an empty stomach just to make sure I wasn't mistaken. Not even my pit bull would touch these (he's a bit of a snob though). These just sit on the cupboard (on death-row) awaiting their expiration date .,Neutral
"These chips are a great idea! Nice potato flavor with a satisfying crunch. But . . . . waaaaaay tooooo salty. I literally had to blow off the salt to be able to taste any potato flavor! I've tried the 'sour cream and onion' flavor, and that was fine. Just too much salt on the 'regular' flavor.",Neutral
i usually love spicy chips... but somehow don't find these appealing... next time i think i will try the plain ones first! these are light and crunchy...,Neutral
"I love Pop chips- have tried many flavors and enjoyed them due to the low calorie count and they satisfy my craving for salt! With that said, I was so excited when I heard Pop Chips had come out with a Jalapeno Chip!<br />I am sad to say the Jalapeno chip just misses the mark. Both my husband and I agreed there is something off about them and seeing as we usually love other kinds of jalapeno chips, these were just not good. Save your money, don't get the jalapeno chips flavor.",Neutral
"I really didn't care much for this flavor or should I say ""lack of"" flavor.  I bought a case of bar-be-que also and they have much more taste.",Neutral
"I love the texture of these crisps.  They have a light, delicate crunch and an airy feel to them.  The chili lime flavor did leave a lot to be desired.  I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.<br /><br />Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!",Neutral
i dont get the big deal. First of all they are not nearly as delicious as regular chips so they dont even satisfy the same chip craving in me. They taste okay but slightly carboardy styrofoamy - i.e qualities that you do NOT want in a chip,Neutral
"I have to agree with the recent reviews, these are just so so as far as taste.  I bought them as a lightning deal special thinking these would be a little healthier and keep me away from the Kettle chips that I love...after eating a bag of these, I want the Kettle chips back.  They are ok but not as good as a fried chip.  Maybe eating these will discourage me from chips period.  Like some other people making comments, I'll probably finish the box and not buy again.  They remind me of Pringle chips just smaller and maybe a little puffier.",Neutral
"I bought the BBQ flavor.  From time to time you want some chips with a sandwich, or maybe just a salty snack.  The BBQ flavoring is good, but these chips are not as good as fried chips.  Frankly they don't taste good enough to keep my attention as a stand-alone snack.  I eat a few then lose interest.  I'll probably use them as a side with a sandwich.",Neutral
"I've tried some of the other pop chips flavors - and they have MUCH more flavor. My kids, however, absolutely love these and since they're so much healthier than potato chips (I hope) I'll probably just continue ordering them.",Neutral
I absolutely LOVE the BBQ popchips.  They are my favorite but when I saw they had Chili Lime I thought that would be even better. Not so much. I purchased an entire box of 12 of the 3oz bags and wish I would have just stuck to my BBQ.,Neutral
"At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",Neutral
"As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",Neutral
"Normally I prefer plain chips, even though I don't eat them often. The chili lime is pretty good, great with some guacamole. These chips are very crisp, with a strong potato flavor, but also have a slightly burnt taste.",Neutral
"I used to think these were basically ""potato crack"" but they have changed the way they process them with my last batch.  They seemed flat and overcooked.  Hopefully, things will get back to normal with the next order.",Neutral
"BBQ was out-of-stock when our subscription order was due, so I tried these. Still light and less fatty, but the flavor is off.",Neutral
"I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips), but have to say, because they are a little tart, I don't seem to be eating them as quickly, (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar, you will like these.",Neutral
"These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.",Neutral
"I love Pop Chips. Parmesan Garlic and Sour Cream and Onion Pop Chips rock my world. They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others.",Neutral
"I have a bag of Popchips everyday with lunch. So needless to say I love Popchips. When I saw a new flavor available on Amazon of course I had to try it. Chili Lime sounded interesting, and it is indeed an interesting flavor. There is a big hint of lime along with the ""chili"" flavor which is hard to explain. I think this is one of those things that you just have to try for yourself if it sounds interesting. They're decent enough that I will finish off the box, but I can't say I would buy this flavor again.",Neutral
"I ordered this box of potato chips a few months ago. I love the popchips, it tastes great.<br />One thing I have problem is it's little too salty for me. Anyone who has less tolerance of salt should be careful.",Neutral
"I like that it's not greasy and has less calories, but it's a little salty side, and it doesn't taste like potato chips I'm used to. It tastes like rice cakes with a hint of potato flavor (I guess that's how 'pop'things taste like). I like that it's less of a guilty pleasure, but I don't think I will buy it again.",Neutral
"They're ok, but not much flavor in the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor. I might try the multigrain flavor.",Neutral
"I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.  Around 100 calories and 3 grams of fat is still a very good snack, in my opinion.  I would buy these again.",Neutral
"I am surprised just how yummy these chips are and my kids ADORE them. They have no artificial anything which is important as my kids are on the Feingold diet which eliminates all artificial coloring, preservatives, and flavors. The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, ""sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil."" Hmmmm... that's not very definitive!<br /><br />Sunflower and safflower oil are good but canola is a FRANKENFOOD that I don't want my kids to eat. Sigh... a yummy possibility spoiled by canola oil.",Neutral
"After sampling a bag of Pop Chips, I was excited about buying a large box from Amazon and stocking up on these healthy but tasty snacks. The chips themselves are a bit airy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth after you crunch into them, and they pack a lot of flavor! However, after the first couple of bags, I found the flavor was overwhelming and that the aftertaste was a bit too salty for my taste. The product itself is good, but the quantity was just too much for our household! Be sure you can eat 12 bags of these chips before they go stale, or just stick to buying one bag at a time at your local grocery store.",Neutral
"I had to fight to open the sweet potato chip bag because my mind just doesn't want me to be eating sweet potato chips.  Anyway...I get the bag open and I expected them to be gross.  The chips are not gross. They taste like sweet potatos which to me means they need some butter flavor added  to make them taste good.  As it stands, they taste like an unflavored bake potatoe without any butter.<br /><br />I tried to eat a whole bag and they kept getting stuck in my teeth so I gave up.  Also, it just doesn't feel right to be eating sweet potato chips.  I have a whole box of them so I am going to continue to try to get used to them.<br />====<br /><br />Update: I still have a box of these chips left.  I couldn't stomach them, my co-workers said they were too bland, and my friend co-worker said they taste like unflavored cornflakes.<br /><br />I don't see how these will be a hit in stores.",Neutral
"I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you.",Neutral
Amendment - Still GREAT - BUT Just reordered - 45% increase since May 12 - 45% is NUTS - Product GOOD but 25.00 to 36.00 ! !

"Mixed reviews for this product. Some people liked it very much, some of them hated it. When i first tried it, they tasted horrible. But somehow I liked it when i had them the next time. Very light, flavored, spicy. The texture on the chips look good, but the after taste is not that great. That was my review. But a couple of my colleagues liked them so much that they had 2 bags of it at once. they loved the taste, flavor and also the after taste. 100 cal per bag with 0 cholesterol, not a bad bet!",Neutral
"I normally love Popchips.  I couldn't find them in the local stores so I ordered them here.  The flavor doesn't seem as good... they are a little more browned,thinner and seemed more crispy in a harder sort of way.  I don't know if the batch was off or if they have changed how they make them.  I was disappointed.",Neutral
Pop chips are great but you really have to be a garlic lover to enjoy this one as a snack.,Neutral
"The seasoning is too heavy. I will eat them, but only because I ordered a bunch.",Neutral
"I shared these with friends at work.  The consensus is that they taste good, if not quite what some people expected.  Those who enjoy sweet potato fries liked them better than those with no experience in that area.  Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.  I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack-size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.",Neutral
"In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.",Neutral
"NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",Neutral
"I use this as a whey/soy protein alternative. I am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both. I actually haven't used it as a shake, but I use it to make protein pancakes. I find I have to add extra cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and stevia to make it more sweet. At first I came out with some really awful pancakes, but after I found the perfect ingredients to doctor it up, they all come out amazing!!! So if your looking for an alternative to whey and soy, I definitely think this is a good choice!",Neutral

I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE TASTE WITH ALL OF MY HEALTH PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT A LOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.  IT JUST TASTE LIKE WATERED DOWN CHOCOLATE TO ME.  I DRINK IT WITH WATER OR SOMETIMES WITH RICE MILK BECAUSE I NEED THE EXTRA CALORIES ON DAYS THAT I CAN'T HANDLE SOLID FOODS.  HOWEVER,ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, IT DOES CONTAIN SOY. HOW MUCH I COULDN'T SAY AS IT WASN'T LISTED ON THE INGREDIGENT COLUMN.  I FOUND IT MENTIONED ON THE BACK OF THE LABEL STATING THAT IT CONTAINED SOY LETICHEN(THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT).  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH.  IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INFO.

"This is a ketchup I've been really looking forward to trying. Having read the reviews, here and elsewhere, there is pretty good agreement about its merits. Depending on where you look, some people concentrate on its similarity to Heinz, while others talk about how different it is. Here on Amazon, a lot of reviewers feel it's similar to Heinz, some even say it's the same. I expected it to be comparable. It isn't, except that both are good.<br /><br />The difference is in the taste and consistency. The taste of Heinz is much more aggressive than Organicville. You could say it has more zing or kick. I'd imagine its vinegar and sugar content is pretty high. The consistency of Heinz is thicker, and yet smoother, sort of like paint. The Organicville feels lighter, and looks ""grainier"", though it is smooth, of course. It looks more ""natural"", while Heinz has a processed, technicolor look.<br /><br />Neither is better than the other. They're two different animals. Having said that, I'm not sure I like the Organicville, at least on the hamburger I tested it on. I also tried it plain. So while I seemed to be enjoying the new and different taste and texture, and letting myself adjust to the more laid back material, by the last bit of my burger I wasn't dipping it in--and enjoyed that better.<br /><br />Rating the item is actually easier than I thought. One star means ""I hate it"", two stars means ""I don't like it"". I certainly don't hate it, and I wouldn't say I actively dislike it. Five stars means ""I love it"", four stars means ""I like it"". I don't love it and I really can't say I like it, leaving 3 stars or ""It's OK"". I think it's better than ok. But somehow, it doesn't grab me.",Neutral
"I love the taste, but on reading the name and ingredients, I'm perplexed. The name touts ""honey-roasted peanuts"" but honey is not listed as an ingredient.  There are a lot of sugars, no wonder they taste good. I will probably keep eating them, but what ever happened to truth in advertising?",Neutral

"I should have known when I saw corn syrup as the first ingredient.  This is glorified jelly.  I hoped there would be more whole raspberries or at least pieces in the filling but could not find many (if any) in two cans.  Admittedly, I purchased this to use as a topping for cottage cheese instead of baked goods.  It is terrible in that capacity.  I prefer Comstock pie fillings, which have actual fruit instead of a bunch of congealed syrup.<br /><br />UPDATE: I found I enjoyed this very much as a topping for greek yogurt.  It is still too high in sugar to enjoy regularly though.",Neutral
"I used to love Shake N Bake when I was a kid. I also remember my mother not caring for it. Now I see why after trying it for the first time in years. There are pros & cons. It doesn't taste bad, but it's very bland to me. I just feel like it needs a little something extra. The pro side is that it is extremely fast & easy, just wet the chicken, throw it in a ziploc bag with the packet contents & shake it up. Once in the oven it bakes up nicely with a crispy exterior & keeps the chicken moist. I just wish it had more flavor. As for shipping, you get a clear plastic bag with 12 pouches inside. Someone else mentioned using this to flavor dishes, I could definitely see this as a crispy topping on baked mac & cheese.",Neutral
"If you are here - you probably already know if you want this product or not, so here is a basic review for your reading pleasure.  Shake `n Bake is an old school classic.  It is crunchy and tasty, but not full of pizzazz - it is a bit bland, but sticks around in the same nostalgic way that Twinkies, Hamburger Helper, Ketchup, and Jell-o do ... these products will never die, but I highly doubt they will ever again enjoy the glory days they once had.  The very best part about shake `n bake is that it serves as Ricky Bobby's (ever fun to say) slogan ... SHAKE `N BAKE!!!!  That's right!  That JUST happened!!!!",Neutral
"I don't have any real ""issues"" with this product.  The small packages are fine for a small batch, which of course is the reason for these small envelopes instead of a large can.  Sometimes you'll open a large can and if you don't use it, then it becomes ""stale"".  But on the other hand, bread crumbs can be a lot less expensive.  Also, if you want to spice-it-up, then try adding a little extra seasoning. . . . For example, a little cayenne pepper or hot pepper flakes.  Perhaps a bit of Mrs. Dash.  How about a touch of garlic powder.  You might also try jerk seasoning. . . Cajon seasoning. .  .or other dry seasoning blend.",Neutral
"I had never used Shake 'N' Bake before trying this out. It's incredibly simple, and it bakes up nicely with a crunchy exterior. The flavor, though, isn't the best. I normally use flour and a mix of spices as a coating for chicken, and that tastes better (and is cheaper) than buying Shake 'N' Bake. I did find a great use for the Shake 'N' Bake, though--I coated wedged potatoes with it, then drizzled them with olive oil and baked them for about an hour at 375 degrees. Delicious! (I don't know why it tasted so much better on the potatoes than on the chicken, but it did.) The Shake 'N' Bake comes in a pack of 12, and I'll be using the remaining packs to make more oven baked potato wedges.",Neutral
I remember eating Shake 'N Bake when I was a kid. I think I even got the privilege of shaking the ole Ziploc baggie. I recently tried the Original Chicken flavor. I think the individual serving packs are great size. I even tried this on Tilapia tonight and it was pretty good. It's a great alternative to fried foods. I like that it is a really quick and easy meal solution. It takes less than 30 minutes from start to finish.,Neutral
"It's Shake n Bake...I doubt anyone is unfamiliar with this product.  It's okay, but I I'd prefer some flavor, seasoning in the mix, but it gives the meat a nice crunch.  Simple to use.  It says it's for chicken, but we used it on fish as well.  There's not much else I can think of to add.",Neutral
"Very disappointed with the direction Healthy Choice has taken with all of its former ""Fresh Mixers"" line, especially the ones that contain chicken.  I am changing my rating on all of these products from 5 stars to 3 stars.  With the switch to ""Lunch Express,"" apparently they decided to lower their production costs and make more on each unit.  First, they removed the handy green plastic strainer -- consumers are now supposed to be able to judge the exact amount of water that can be absorbed by the pasta or rice, aided by a lower water line in the container.  Second, in case you haven't read the fine print on the sauce containers, they have replaced the nice large chunks of white chicken meat with smaller, diced pieces of dark chicken meat.  I saved a few of the old green plastic strainers and they still fit the newer containers.  The convenience, taste and portioning are still attractive, so I'm continuing my subscription for now -- which is probably what Healthy Choice is counting on -- but just wanted to state my disappointment over yet another company placing greed over customer satisfaction.",Neutral

Probably not, because this product essentially makes a cup of slightly tea-flavored boiled water.",Neutral

"I love Earl Grey. I love Zhena's Earl Green. I do not love Zhena's Earl ""Greater"" Grey: it is not greater. There's very little bergamot flavor, at least in the batch I got. In fact if I didn't know it's supposed to be Earl Grey I'd say it's only a fairly good black tea with no bergamot at all. Even just opening the tin, I got no whiff of bergamot, and certainly there's none in the finished tea, even using double tea bags. Maybe I just got a bad batch, but although it's passable tea, it's very bad Earl Grey.<br /><br />For real Earl Grey, I strongly recommend The Republic of Tea's ""Earl Greyer."" It is by far the most delicious Earl Grey I have tried. Unfortunately Amazon doesn't (yet?) carry the tea bags, but it is worth the trouble of a loose tea, to have actual Earl Grey (bergamot) flavor in your Earl Grey tea.",Neutral

Only real complaint is that it's a little skimpy and you definately need to make a salad on the side to get ""filled up"".  Also, when you buy in bulk like this you save close to a dollar a can compared to what my local supermarket charges for these.  It's not worth the price that way.  It's just barely worth it to me at the usual price (in bulk) that Amazon sells it for. Health Valley should lower the price just a bit or add more noodles and vegetables in the can.

Whenever she jumps in my lap after eating this stuff, it about makes me gag!  It has to be the strangest smelling cat food I've ever used, which is why I wanted to write this review.  Just thought it was rather strange. I don't plan on buying it again because of that - the smell is Blech!  It isn't her favorite food, but it's tolerable, especially if mixed with a little meat.  The protein content isn't as high, only 30% because it's for the indoor cat.  I would recommend it for that reason because it does help with the weight factor.

"I was always a big fan Of Gloria Jeans Raspberry chocolate beans as they made a wonderful cup of coffee and the house smelled so good just from having the beans around.  When I saw the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry I ordered it hopping to have the same great flavor and aroma.  I opened the box and no aroma, thought ok they are packed so well the aroma can't excape.  I brewed 2 cups 2 different sizes.  Smelled good while brewing.  This coffee is not strong and is very smoothe but all I could taste was the raspberry, no chocolate at all.  The next cup I actually added some chocolate milk to hoping for the chocolate to come through.  No go, that didn't even help.  If you want a raspberry flavored coffee this is good for that, but don't expect any chocolate flavor.  I have had my Keurig about 4 years and have gone through some coffee so I know what I enjoy and this isn't it and now I have 4 boxes to go through.  Maybe Van Houtte brand isn't for me.

I will definitely try the other Kyjen games and see if they are more challenging.",Neutral
"Not a bad starter puzzle, especially for the price.<br /><br />My Lab/Border Collie had it totally figured out within about 20 minutes, so it wasn't super challenging for her. She had more issues with the cups located in the ""palm"" section of the paw. It was hard for her to get her mouth on them, and almost impossible to ""slide up.""<br /><br />The primary complaint I have with this toy are the yellow cups. They are flimsy and could be easily cracked into pieces with very minimal effort for a decent sized dog, or an aggressive chewer.<br /><br />DEFINITELY do not leave your dog alone with the toy. (This should go without saying..but...)<br /><br />Would I recommend the toy? Maybe. I think it would be ideal for medium sized dogs that aren't too smart for their own good.

"clearly the more expensive puzzle games may offer more, but for what you pay, this is nice.  My dog enjoyed it, and caught on after a try or 2.  at first she took the yellow cover and ran... thinking that was the prize, but i called her back to show her the treats, and then it was on!",Neutral

It was also hard for him to rotate it on its base to expose the other treats.  I think this is a fine toy for bigger dogs, but Liam is only 7.7 lbs.  My husband also didn't like all the noise.",Neutral

"It is fun for my toy poodle, but the yellow ""caps"" are too large for him to get his mouth around to remove them. He does enjoy moving the ""cover"" around so he can retrieve the treats.",Neutral
"My morkie loves interactive games. Make sure you take notice of the dimensions, it is larger than I expected. As one of the other reviews stated, my small breed cannot get his mouth around the yellow pieces, but is able to get them off with abundant effort via scratching and using his nose. As smart as my lil guy is, he gets the yellow piece off and thinks his reward is being able to play with it. But it was his first attempt and we're working with him, showing him the treats are underneath. He was continuously excited and determined to figure out the game. I expect over time he'll get better with it and the learning process in itself is fun.",Neutral
"Paw Hide- she sniffed a little and went straight to the covers and after she got one off trotted away like that was the prize! I showed her the treats and she proceeded to get them all. She figured it out pretty quick. I use it as a more challenging way of dispensing treats now.<br /><br />Star Spinner- she spun the thing and figured it out pretty quickly. Not much of a challenge there. Still, a fun way to dispense treats.<br /><br />Treat triad- this one was the most challenging, as it has 2 parts to it. She turned the red part around and then went to open the containers. Therein lies the rub. IMO, the container cover extends too far down so as to make it very difficult for her to grasp it with her mouth or her paw. She was unable to get a grip on it so she could not get to the treats. She didn't like this one.<br /><br />Overall, I don't find them to be that challenging, except for the Treat Triad but that one, I think, has a design flaw. Its not mentally challenging but physically so. I'm not sorry I got them but I expected more.",Neutral
"This is a good product, my dog opened the doors twice and found the treat.  After the second time she just picked the toy up and turned it upside down till the treats fell out.  For a small dog it might work better",Neutral
"I bought this as a birthday gift for my dog.  The plastic is pretty thin.  He loves tennis balls and playing fetch, so I thought it would be a great brain teaser.  He figured out how to lift the doors to get at the tennis ball, but when he goes to grab it, it ends up rolling back into the trunk and over to another hole.  Then he just gets irritated.  It slides easily on the hardwood floor, so he ends up pushing it around the room trying to get the ball out.  We put it on a rug to keep it from sliding around and then the doors don't open as easily.  I'm going to try to put some rubber slip grip stuff on the bottom to see if that helps keep it in place on the hardwood floor better.  He tries to dig the tennis ball out of the top opening since the doors don't work too well and then he ends up knocking the whole top portion off.",Neutral
"No seriously, she is.  My dog's ""grandfather"" (my Dad) sent this as a first birthday gift. I videotaped it - 1st time, 23 seconds, including eating 4 treats.  She moved 1 piece with  her nose, ate treat, one with right paw, ate treat, one with left paw (she's ambidextrous), ate treat, and moved last piece with her nose, ate treat, ta dah!!  It was pretty entertaining. It won't slow down treat eating for her, but I can show her off. And it is very durable. I will try some of Kyjen's harder puzzles!",Neutral
"This product is so light weight. It is easily tipped over. The plastic is not very heavy and if the dog is very rough with it at all, the doors can snap off, even break off which was the experience that I had with the first one I owned.<br />I would not recomment this product.",Neutral
"After the first go-round, my little mutt knew exactly how to get at the hidden treats.  Treats are always welcome, but I think she gets more fun being put in a ""sit"" and watching me move around pretending to hide a bon-bon in various places. She's learned that it won't usually be in the last place I stop - but in which other one? Dogs are as different as the rest of us, but seems to me that only a rather slow dog or a lovable-but-dumb one would find this toy mentally challenging after the first time or two.  I give it three stars for their sakes.",Neutral

"I was hoping that we would like this product more, however we just can't get over the texture. We found that it was easy to mix and made somewhat flat pancakes (we really like fluffy) Overall - I'd suggest buying one pack at your local store before springing for a pack of 4. On the other hand, the birds seem to LOVE this mix so I've been delighted to see them outside my window :)",Neutral
"These are great tasting tofu jerky strips!  Low in fat, high in protein, and pretty low in calories (99 calories in this flavor) across the board.  This flavor can be a bit spicy, depending on the batch.  My last batch was great, but the current one has some very small, but whole peppercorns throughout the jerky.  It's still good, but I'm on the fence as to which batch I prefer.  The only real complaint I have is that the packaging is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to open without a pair of scissors.  It's not real great for on-the-go when you have to wrestle with the package with both hands and your teeth to get it open.  I can't understand why they made the packaging this way, what a bummer.",Neutral
"The first thing I noticed is that it smells JUST like the canned cat food I give my cat. This was a big turn-off, but I have had good experiences with wheat gluten in the past, so I gave it a shot. The flavor is nice, and has a decent aftertaste. The texture is OK, but not what I would expect from a ""jerky"".. I would have preferred something much chewier. I did eat them, but it's not something I will purchase again.",Neutral
"... then these strips are for you.  A friend of mine introduced me to them, and admittedly, they taste pretty good, but the seitan has a color and texture that will make you think you are eating human flesh.  It's horrifying, and yet afterwards you'll be craving more, which is all the more horrifying.<br /><br />So, 5 stars for taste, 1 star for cannibalism... 3 stars overall.",Neutral
"I'm torn. I love these strips. They feel like the real thing and they taste great (even my dog loves it...he doesn't care if it's veggie), but they're so moist. They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.",Neutral
"I didn't read the ingredients carefully enough to see that these are gluten-free. Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.<br /><br />The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet. Additionally, the Hickory Smoked Soy flavor was waaaaay too sweet and reviewers have said that about other flavors as well.<br /><br />I'll finish the box I purchased, but I probably won't buy more.",Neutral
"I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward.",Neutral
"Not a good flavor overall. I have only tried the TERIYAKI flavored strips, and hate them. The texture and the sweetness is just gross together. I'm going to try a different flavor before writing this off, but yuck. I'm a vegan by the way, and I've had some amazingly delicious fake-feet products: this is not one of them.",Neutral
"Before I was vegetarian, there were few meat products that I even liked. Jerky was one of them, and I have had no luck finding a replacement.<br /><br />This is NOTHING like real jerky. It is very chewy in a SOFT way, and the flavoring was overpowering to the point that I ended up with a stomachache.<br /><br />It is OK. I wouldn't buy it again, but it's not disgustingly bad or anything. Just know if you're looking for an alternative to jerky that this fails both the taste and texture test.",Neutral
"I found the flavor and consistency of this fudge to just be OK. The consistency was a tad grainy where it should have a smooth texture. I remember when my mom made fudge it would occasionally turn out grainy and she said it was because the humidity caused the sugar in the candy to crystalize. I don't know if that is the case with this fudge or not, but both this and another Gardiners of Scotland fudge I bought have the same graininess. Further the flavors were odd. The Rum and Raisin was ok, but the raisins had no flavor. The apple and cinnamon didn't taste like apple or cinnamon nor did the strawberry and cream taste like strawberries. I think there was one ginger flavored piece in the can and it was flavorless. I won't be buying Gardiners of Scotland fudge again.",Neutral
"I bought this fudge expecting a more creamy fudge.  I was disappointed.  It has a strange undercooked grainy texture that I didn't like.  My canister was mainly rum raisin and that was my least liked flavor, it is made with real rum and I do not consume alcohol.  The ginger tasted odd and the strawberry didn't have any strawberry flavor.  I did like the Clotted cream it was very good, but only 2 in the pack.  I would not buy it again.",Neutral

That flavor shocked me and I liked it the most! It reminded me of a Starbucks vibe, only better.

I would like to see a ""variety"" pack containing 2 of each flavor that Green Mountain has to offer... now that would be cause for a rating of 4 or 5 stars!!!",Neutral

To add a coating of milk-chocolate (which melts as soon as you try to dunk one) to such a confection is really taking things altogether too far, producing a sickly mismatch of tastes and textures that will appeal only to the young of pallet. Or, perhaps, to the glutton.<br /><br />Perhaps the final clue that this was never intended for a British market is to be found in the fact that McVitie have here dispensed with the modest paper wrapper of a ""proper"" packet of biscuits and chosen to sell these items in a plastic tube.

Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)",Neutral
"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai, 2-Ounce Bags (Pack of 24)</a>. Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.",Neutral

Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are ""Krinkle Cut"" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth.

"I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.",Neutral
"We have tried the log, thick slice, and thin slice versions.  The thinner the slice, the faster to cook and overcook.  We never found the correct way to cook this without causing it to dry out.  We never steamed it.  We prefer the thicker slice version.<br /><br />The high cost we assume is based on four factors; high density product, reduced fat, high spice content, and presumably using better cuts of meat.  When fat is reduced, the desired flavor profile requires more spices, but makes cooking more difficult.<br /><br />The texture is closer to hard (than soft) salami.  The fat content appears much less than bologna or spam lite.  Spam does have hints of ham flavor after slow frying; not discerned in (this brand of) pork roll. Excepting any ham flavor, the flavor profile is stronger and better than (regular) bologna and distinct from spam, in our opinion.  The first time we tried it, everyone designated it as ""Beverly Hills spam.""  Unlike my former acquaintances from Jersey and Philly, we were not won over, but understood their longing for memorable home foods.<br /><br />Our local Publix carries the thin sliced version and the one-pound mini-log ($8), whereas we previously ordered online or found it while traveling.  If you elect to try it, invite some friends over for a sharing experience...just ensure you have practiced cooking it to your satisfaction before offering it to a group.

I typically added a couple ounces of homemade organic vege with an ounce of breastmilk plus the Earth Best oat and rice together with Happy Bellies, hoping to keep it thick a little longer, but to no avail. I am writing this review because I just threw out another bowl of food because my baby refuses to eat it after a couple spoons since it literally just became soup despite I made it *thick*.",Neutral
"They look nice, but taste is bland and feel is rubbery. I simply satue'd them with onions in oil for 15 min on low heat until they became golden brown. The smaller pieces are tasty but big ones are very tough. I have not tried them in stong sauces, but no far it's dissapointing",Neutral
"Purchased the roasted chicken flavor and product looks just as pictured.  Ingredients seems simple enough and the biscuits actually held up well during the shipping.  The only problem I have is that my dog does not care for it much.  She would eat it if I handed it to her, but the buddy biscuits fail miserably as a motivational tool. If I pull the buddy biscuits out of the box, she would initially look at me then just continue what she was doing earlier.  I know all dogs are different with their own tastes, but my dog loves to eat everything edible (and sometimes non-edible). To give an idea how her tastes are compared to your dog i'll list some items.<br /><br />She would eat...<br />Dog food brands (does not matter what flavors I tried with each brand): Natural Balance, Avoderm, Blue Buffalo, Orijen, Pedigree<br />Veggies:  Carrots, cabbage, lettuce, bell peppers, chili peppers (I have a chili pepper plant in the yard)<br /><br />She won't eat...<br />Citrus fruits (lemons and oranges)<br /><br />Basically, I assumed my dog would love to eat any treat and I purchased this because of the ingredients and cost. Sadly, I bought it in the 6pack and she isn't too fond of the treats.  I'm giving 3 stars for my situation, but your dog maybe different and love them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Biscuits held up well during shipping<br />-Ingredients<br />-Cheap<br /><br />Negative:<br />-Fails to motivate dog or get her attention<br /><br />Pros? / Negative?:<br />-Dog will eat it....(although she would spit it out after I hand it to her, then stare at it, then look at me, and eventually eat it if I don't pull out another type of treat)",Neutral
"Ok, so I have to say that I did not enjoy the True Lemon Lemonade nearly as much as I enjoyed the True Lemon Raspberry Lemonade.  It didn't have nearly as much flavor, and the flavor it did have wasn't much like lemonade to me.  But the ingredients were still pretty good, and that's really what makes this brand stand out from the others.<br /><br />True Lemon products boast that they have 100% natural ingredients.  And its true, they do.  They use stevia instead of artificial sweeteners and actual lemon oil and juice for the flavoring.  This makes me think at least that what I'm drinking is healthy.  There's even some turmeric for color in here and that's actually a beneficial spice.  So all in all, a good product on the market.  A lot healthier than some of the other drink additives out there.<br /><br />The taste, not as good in this one.  Its not terrible, like some of the water additives I've tried, but it tastes extremely weak.  That and the pale yellow color the water turns it just isn't appetizing.  Its still got a sweet taste, but the tanginess of the lemon isn't really there and it more just tastes like sugar water.  I would say their estimate on the amount of flavoring per water ratio may be off and perhaps two packets would be a better choice for the water.  It may be something I have to try.<br /><br />I probably won't buy this particular flavor from True Lemon again, but it won't stop me from trying some of their other products.  And I will definitely get their Raspberry Lemonade again.  I just hope that maybe they improve this one or keep adding new products to their line up. It sure does help when that soda craving kicks in and I can have one of these instead.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",Neutral
"One of the main reasons I purchased this specific product was because it says it has red in it.  The package, itself, states ""red"" as one of the colors.  Of the 36, there was not a single red.  The majority of the package was pink.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />So unless you are looking for pink, I would shop elsewhere.",Neutral
"I was buying Mastic supplements for my stomach and came across this gum; it said it was a product of Lebanon so I was intrigued but when the gum arrived, the box says it's from Jordan. Also, it doesn't actually say it's got real mastic in it - the words natural identical flavor (mastic)does not convince me it actually has mastic in it... plus, the glucose and stuff has me suspicious that it's not really healthful...but the taste is good enough to chew, different, interesting and I will chew it daily to see if it helps me...still, I'm very disappointed that it's not from Lebanon.

"Big Mistake. I ordered two cases of these Crown Prince Sardines when my local store stopped stocking my usual brand (King Oscar) which were on back order.

Haha- and I ordered 2 cases, suppose I could return them-but then I have to pay shipping back- ate them at first-out of stubborness- but then just gave up hoping maybe I just hit a bad can or two. Lesson learned- don't jump too deeply into that online case deal- try an individual one first unless you have alot of experience with the products at hand. I will stick to Nordiac/Brisling sardines for now on- have never had a bad can or off taste with these in water or olive oil.",Neutral
"As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised. Local chefs of gourmet restaurants can sometimes tip you off to the good purveyors (if they are worth anything). If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag. You want good? Empty out your bank account and buy fresh.",Neutral

"I love this rice!  It truly is ""tender and delicious"" as stated on the package.  Keep in mind that even though it is a product of California, this is a Japanese-style brown rice, thus more polished than American-style brown rice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a few months after posting this review I have had some  bad batches of this rice, regardless of the place of purchase (I tried a nearby Japanese food store as well as a mail-order Korean store).  I also had that experience when buying it already cooked (as part of the bento lunches at a nearby Japanese cafe). It is as if the rice is on its way to being rancid.  If anyone knows what the problem is and how to recognize it before I buy a pack, please let me know because when it is good, it is outstanding.",Neutral
"Before purchasing this product I had read that it was close in taste to Lavazza...which is lighter in taste and not bitter at all.

I love the Donut House Extra Bold Decaf.  Best decaf of all the brands that I have tried and I have tried many.  I ordered here and expected to get what I ordered.  What I got was the light roast that was NOT extra bold.  It actually did not say Extra Bold on the label.  By this time though I had thrown the box away loading the k-cups onto the carousel. Now I know that I must watch closely and examine each and every one as I load it into my machine to make sure it is what I think it is so I am not so disappointed in the future.  I won't buy from here again.  Someone is responsible for the switch.  I expect to get what I pay for.,Neutral

"Crystal Light's Peach Iced Tea is a little sweeter than other flavors like the Raspberry Lemonade. It has a very mild tea flavor that is pleasant and not overpowering. Since we already lug tons of bottled water from Costco it is great not to have to also buy bottled drinks. The Crystal Light packets make drinking more water a breeze. Since I started using these packets I keep water in the refrigerator and mix up some tea for when I'm reading or out shopping. I also love to make slushies with this drink mix.

I introduced it to him in a 50/50 mix for one weeks and there were no problems transitioning to the new food.  Merrick Whole earth Farms Adult dry dog food is grain based dog food with chicken and turkey being it's main sources of protein.  There are no real taboo ingredients in this mix and has turned out to be a great choice.  Compared to puppy plate his stools are equally firm, but slightly smaller, indicating better digestion.

"I buy Pike's place from my local Starbuck's and have them grind it for my french press.

"Whenever I finish a strenuous workout, the first thing I want to do is slam a cold, thick milkshake down my throat. There's nothing quite as refreshing as a creamy, sickly sweet, dairy-based beverage to cool you down after pushing your body to its breaking point. I've slammed can after can of this and felt like a Superman.<br /><br />But seriously, I think that's exactly what this drink is for. No, really? I'm supposed to devour a 370 calorie milkshake after every workout? I understand it contains a lot of protein, but at 370 calories, you might as well be eating liquid hamburger. Oh, I see this is also supposed to be a ""meal replacement."" Just don't let your kids drink these to the exclusion of actual food.<br /><br />The milkshake was alright, though. Honestly, it wasn't much more than a Carnation Instant Breakfast. It had that same taste and consistency. And despite its calories, it didn't fill me up at all. I guess that's what you get for drinking your calories. I probably wouldn't get it again.",Neutral
"I enjoyed the vanilla flavor of this shake.  It was smooth, not gritty.  Although I am not sure I would be a regular user of this.  After a workout I am not concerned with replenishing calories.  If I am I will have a piece of chicken.  Usually I am more concerned with hydration.  I am not knocking this product for its lack of hydration (it is not meant to be used for that), I am just explaining why I would not use it regularly.  I could see that it would be nice if I know I have to run off somewhere and I can having anything to eat.<br /><br />That said, I did not find this shake very filling.  Within the hour I was looking for something else to eat.",Neutral
"Taste: The taste was very appealing. It was very flavorful and sweet and had the texture of a vanilla milkshake. In terms of performance/protein drinks, this ranks very highly compared to the rest of the competition.<br /><br />Packaging: The packaging was a little lacking. The overall design on the can was pretty appealing, however, instead of printing on the can, the printing was on a plastic sheet wrapped around the can. This caused it to interfere with the mouth of the can and plastic was able to work its way inside my mouth.<br /><br />Size: The size was 11 fluid ounces, which seemed a little bit small for a post workout shake, depending on how rigorous your routine is. In general, it is a pretty good compliment to a high protein meal post workout.<br /><br />Nutrition: This product has a very high calorie content compared to what it offers in protein. It has almost 400 calories against only about 20 grams of protein. If you are just starting out and are looking to put on weight quickly, this would probably be a very good place to start. However, I would not recommend this product to those trying to build lean muscle.<br /><br />Overall: I would say this product would do well for those trying to put on weight quickly. It's high calorie content against a decent amount of protein makes it a pretty good weight-gainer. However, if you are either trying to lose fat or put on lean muscle, I would not recommend use of this product.",Neutral
This product gets 3 stars from the taste alone. Most protein shakes taste like chalk mixed with milk. But this one has a very good taste that makes you want to drink more of it. It is high in protein o it would be a great drink to have after a rigorous workout. The biggest downfall for the product is it has a lot of sugar in it. I try to avoid a lot of sugar so this wouldn't be the drink for me.,Neutral
"This one is less milkshake-like than the chocolate, with a pudding flavor and a bit of pudding consistency.  It isn't bad, though.  Otherwise, it is about 370 calories per serving, with some fat and protein and a bunch of vitamins to keep you going between meals and workouts.",Neutral

"When I first discovered this product, and how my Toy Fox Terrier puppy reacted to it, I was thrilled.  It was so hard to get her to slow down and do some productive chewing while I was busy.  However, I did notice that her stool was often a bit loose after eating this ""puppy goo"".  I started stuffing her Kong with kibbles to make sure there was substance and not just the gooey stuff, in hopes that I wouldn't have to take it away from her totally.  It seemed to work for a little while, then suddenly, pools of stool again.  Even when I froze the stuff, it didn't help.  Only gave her one a week, didn't help.  It may be that toy breeds have a difficult time with it and heartier dogs will be fine.  But be cautious.<br /><br />One further note:  I've noticed that the textural contents of the cans vary.  Not sure how or why.  Be wary of expiration dates!",Neutral
My dog takes supplements everyday and has for many years. Used to use peanut butter and have used all types. Never really liked doing that because of all the sugar in it. Have tried spreadable cheese too but it's too rich for her system. So saw this while ordering other Kong products and thought I'd give it a try. She's always a little combative but she takes them none the less using this stuff and it doesn't mess up her digestive system. Texture is a little runny even though I refrigerate it but still able to coat her pills well enough with it.,Neutral
"This is great and easy to use, but we'll be sticking to peanut butter (or the Kong Stuff'n breath paste). My dog likes it but it seems like such a waste of money when peanut butter works just as well. If you really like kong stuff'n, try the breath paste, it is great!",Neutral
"My dogs LOVE the taste of this PB Stuff 'N Paste and I like and appreciate the convenience of being able to add PB to their Kongs with no mess whatsoever. That being said, I went through an entire can of this stuff way too fast. The label says it's concentrated and to use it sparingly, so I did. The problem is, if you have large dogs like I have, you will probably go through a can of this in less than two weeks. It's too expensive for me so I'm back to using real PB in their Kongs.",Neutral
"Although my dogs love the taste of this stuff, it's a little runny and tends to flow out of the grooves after I squirt it on groovie-bones, etc. The Peanut Butter Stuff'n Paste is thicker and works better.",Neutral

"A gift basket should be a fun indulgence; something one usually would not purchase for oneself but would be happy to receive or give to another.

"I was overall disappointed with this basket.  While the salami and cheese spread were good, much of the rest of the basket seemed to be fillers.  The box of chocolates actually contained wrapped candy (a mallo cup, a peanut butter cup and some of what was once called penny candy).  There were crackers and pretzels (a small bag contained two hard pretzels).  I realize with a purchase like this you are really paying a premium for the packaging and delivery but I thought this one was a little light on actual food.",Neutral

"So, if you look really closely at the picture of the product, it does say small dogs under the name.  However, it doesn't specify that in the amazon description, which I think is lame.  Suffice to say, these little 3 or so inch diameter patties will not function as anything but the world's most expensive bag of dog treats for my 100 lb. dog.  Had purchased these hoping for lightweight, packable dog food for backpacking that could be rehydrated, but this won't do it. The product itself seems fine if you've got a small dog; it is the lack of proper description that leads to my mediocre review.",Neutral
"I tried the chili lime jerky, and although I like  the texture, I feel the sweetness is overpowering.  Looking at the ingredients, I see corn syrup, sugar, and more sugar.  The spiciness is ok.  I have a sampler of this brand jerky and hope I find another I like better.",Neutral
"I use hot chocolate packets to stir into my coffee.  I normally use Land O'Lakes hot chocolate, but I've had trouble getting some of my favorite flavors, so I wanted to try something new.  I ordered the Bellagio Chocolate Truffle flavor, and I suppose that it gets the job done.  But to make my coffee taste chocolatey enough, I've been having to mix in the Bellagio cocoa with a K-cup hot chocolate.  The flavor's a little flat, and the texture is pretty watery when compared to Land O'Lakes or even regular Swiss Miss.  I don't hate it, but there are better options out there, so I won't be ordering it again.",Neutral

"The description of this product says you can fill it with meats and veggies and the ingredients do not list sugar. I have a hard time believing there is no sugar. This tasted like sugar cookies! My kids' favorite meal is chicken pot pie. They could not eat it because it tasted too weird to have a sugar cookie crust. With that being said, the taste and texture of the crust was great for a dessert pie. Unfortunately, I spent $35 on pie crusts for chicken pot pie that tasted bad.",Neutral

"Quaker Oats have been a staple in my family for generations. It was the only oatmeal that my maternal grandmother prepared, although she always used the Old Fashioned Oatmeal that was actually cooked (and added real sugar, not sweetner, and whole milk for the best oats I ever ate). If she were alive today, I know she would have tried Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the packets. Prepared according to package directions, the oatmeal comes out smooth with no lumps. I found the brown sugar taste more than acceptable, but as usual with maple flavor I don't find it authentic, and there was a bit of an aftertaste. Each packet is one serving, which I don't find sufficient for a whole breakfast, so adding toast and fruit, or bacon or sausage on the side makes for a meal that will stay with you for more than an hour or two. The packets are convenient for campers, hikers, vacationers, or office workers as they do not take up much room, and can be prepared quickly where hot water is available. And they can be eaten just plain, without milk, and still be a  quick meal or snack.",Neutral
"I see that there are a lot of reviews complaining that there is a new recipe for this product and that it's not as good as the old one. Unfortunately, I haven't tried the ""old"" recipe so I can't make a comparison. The box I received says ""Classic Recipe"" so it may be that they have gone back to the old recipe? I'm not sure.<br /><br />I made this oatmeal with milk and found it to average. I don't mind eating it but I've had better. Even though sugar is second on the ingredient list, I didn't think that this oatmeal had a very sweet taste. I could just barely taste brown sugar and I couldn't taste a maple flavor at all. If I'm going to eat something with a lot of added sugar then I want it to taste sweet! This was very filling and kept me full until lunch time.",Neutral
"Running off to work without breakfast?<br /><br />Sometimes a product is just right for the consumer.<br /><br />When my daughter-in-law noticed my box of Quaker instant oatmeal maple and brown sugar, she told me her children, age four and two, love it.<br /><br />So many children skip breakfast and the Quaker Oatmeal gives a person fuel to start the day with energy.<br /><br />It's also good because it has zero saturated fat and is only 160 calories per packet. It's so tasty that it doesn't need anything to add to the flavor but sliced peaches or blueberries are a nice touch.<br /><br />Since the product comes in handy packets, it's also convenient to bring to work and have a quick, energetic snack, all that's needed is to add milk or boiling water and it's all set.<br /><br />It's also microwavable. This is a very good product.",Neutral
"This Quaker instant oatmeal tastes good, however in order to truly feel like you have had a fulfilling meal, you need at least two of the packets as a serving. I brought this to work so I would have something to eat when I forgot to bring my breakfast in. It is a little dry and the consistency is like that of paste, so I tend to add a little half and half just before serving to make it a little creamier.<br /><br />It is okay in a pinch, but not something that I would want to consume on a daily basis.",Neutral
"This oatmeal is a good choice on very busy, cool mornings. I make it with a little less water than recommended, and it's ready in 60 seconds. The serving size is good, the oatmeal's not overly sweet, and I like the maple/brown sugar flavor.<br /><br />On the con side, the oat size is too small for my preferences. Some other brands have larger pieces. I've found a few pieces of the scratchy part in my bowl, now and then. And the flavor isn't all that well distributed even after I stir well.",Neutral
"I've never been a huge fan of oatmeal in any form. But I've learned to appreciate these instant packets as I get older. They're ready in mere minutes, quite filling, and the taste is not bad--I find Quaker brand far tastier than any generic or store brand I've tried. Maple brown sugar, along with apple cinammon, is among my faves. Add half a banana, and maybe some strawberries, and you have a high energy meal that leaves you feeling full and satisfied for hours. Great for the price and convenience.",Neutral
"The maple and brown sugar combination seems about the right balance for the two but the amount overall covers the oat flavor.  Perhaps it is my personal preference for very little sugar but overall I was disappointed.  With many flavors of instant oats, the Quaker oats are far superior to the competition.  I am not able to detect a great difference in this flavor from many of the cheap store-brand varieties I have tried.  It is acceptable for an occasional variety in breakfast but nothing that sets it apart from others.",Neutral
"I really like oatmeal but I must clarify that I like non-instant oatmeal.  Compared to other instant oatmeal, Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar, tastes pretty much the same. The flavor is nice and doesn't taste artificial but the consistency of the oatmeal itself is pasty.  This is, however, what I'd expect from  instant oatmeal so it's not surprising.  If you generally like instant oatmeal, this one is just fine.<br /><br />I gave this product 3 stars because it's not bad...but not great, either.",Neutral
"I'm biased.  My morning oatmeal is usually mixed in with coffee or near expresso strength coffee.  That way my moring meal can get a nice little jolt.  I didn't think this stuff was bad.  Then again my tastes are like a coyote & I'll munch on near anything.  But Quaker used to make the standard for instant oatmeal.  This stuff is O.K.  I like nearly any instant oatmeal.  So, this stuff is a fair value, it tastes good, and it's not a bad price considering.  I'll buy it again & don't think it's a bad product.",Neutral
"I thought this flavor was a little bland, nothing close to my favorite of raisins, dates, and walnuts.  The oats were fine.  I like that these instant oatmeals are great for on the go and are a better fast breakfast option than most cold, sugary cereals.  My biggest problem with this oatmeal is the sugar content.  Although one packet might be fine for a toddler, anyone over 8 years old would probably need two packets for breakfast; however, with 12 grams of sugar in one packet, that means a two-packet breakfast gives you a whopping 24 grams of sugar!  A better option is to make a bowl of oatmeal, not instant, add less sugar or a sugar substitute, then add spices or other ingredients of your choice. It takes a little more time and effort, but the result is a better tasting, healthier oatmeal.",Neutral
"Just finishing off a bowl (3 packets) of Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar. Its very quick to make, either using fat free milk or water and then microwaving it. Prep time is about 3 minutes. The taste is very good. It's very sweet-about as sweet as the sweetest breakfast cereal. It has a strong maple flavor.<br /><br />I would not go so far as to call this a ""wholesome"" breakfast. A cereal bowl serving-an adult serving that is (3 packets), has about 33% (260mg) of your entire daily sodium intake and a ton of sugar. The sodium upper limit for persons under 51 years of age is 2500 mg per day and for those over 51 or have heart disease the upper limit is only 1500mg. That means that this product isn't quite the 'heart healthy' food Pepsico (Yes) claims it to be. None-the-less, it is a fairly good alternative to many of the breakfast cereals available and probably healthier than a bacon and eggs breakfast. It is however, no substitute for homemade oatmeal in flavor or sodium/sugar content.",Neutral
"Okay, I don't ever buy instant oatmeal like this, we buy bulk organic quick oats and add brown sugar. I have always found instant oatmeal in the little packs to not have good flavor despite all the additives and I always want to add more sugar to make it taste better.  For the most part this oatmeal lived up to my expectations.  I will admit that compared to other maple flavored brands I've tried this one was better, but still, I would not buy this again, and one of my daughters said she didn't like it and won't eat it again, glad I only got one box.  We use genuine maple syrup in our household, and even keep maple sugar for sprinkling on toast, so we are big maple fans, and I guess with genuine maple fans artificial flavor just doesn't cut it.  I even felt like it wasn't quite sweet enough even though it had more sugar in it than the Cinnamon and Spice flavor oatmeal.  Because it has better flavor than other brands of maple flavored oatmeal I've tried, I gave it a 3 stars, saying it was OK is about right.",Neutral
"Oatmeal has become a daily staple of my diet. Most days I just start from the plain oatmeal and add brown sugar and raisins.  But every once in awhile I like to splurge on the pre-packaged oatmeal like I used to eat as a kid.  Sure the sugar is a little higher but nutritionally it's a much better option than other snacks. Only 160 calories per packet. Quaker instant oatmeal packets are just as good as you remember them. If there were any way to improve this product it would be to make the oatmeal a little thicker.  More like rolled oats.  Other than that,  Quaker Maple and Brown Sugar oatmeal is awesome.<br /><br />26JUL12 REVISED RATING: My kids tell me this oatmeal is really bland compared to what they are used too.

"When the package says artificially flavored they really meant it.  Tastes like I'm drinking a Splenda fortified candy from the dollar store.  If you want some more unused groceries filling up your pantry these are a great buy.<br /><br />If you make the coffee really strong, it'll taste a bit better but it still has the Splenda taste.",Neutral
"This is a nice tea, but it has a tendancy to brew too quickly and becomes a little bitter. It helps to add a little sweetner of some kind. IT SMELLS AWESOME! and the blueberry really has a nice flavor. Personally, I still prefer Lipton's ""superfruit green tea"" and would recomend that, but this still a good one to try... just pay attention when you brew it.<br />-J",Neutral

"Its a good deal, but like others have said, not individually packages as pictured. The Stick has a good snap to it when bitten into, but it honestly taste like I am biting into beef flavored shortening, way too fatty even for a beef stick.",Neutral
"Unfortunately I can't recommend these.  I like saving money, but I believe that buying these over the individually wrapped Pack of 84 is a mistake.  I actually bought these and the individually wrapped variety of the same product, so I think I can be a good judge on this decision.<br /><br />One note:  Don't be confused by the picture of this product.  It is NOT individually wrapped as shown.<br /><br />Here's why I can't recommend these:<br /><br />They are dried out, especially compared to the individually wrapped ones.  When I bite into one of these its kind of chewy, not moist at all, has less taste, and is less appealing overall than the individually wrapped ones.  The individually wrapped ones has a lot more taste, moistness (making it easier to bite into), and when you bite into it, you can really taste the freshness.<br /><br />The other, more important reason is that 90% of the time these have caused me... lets just call it ""issues"" in the bathroom shortly after eating them.  I have always had an iron stomach, but I have one stick and these ""issues"" start occurring.  This has been the case since the day I bought them.  This is not AT ALL the case with the individually wrapped beef sticks.  I can have two of those and experience no ""issues.""  I double checked the date on the box (they were new) and also insured that I was properly storing these sticks (I was).  So I really can only blame the fact that they are not fresh enough because they are not individually wrapped.  Possibly there's something more to this.  Maybe Jack Links put more preservatives in the bagged sticks to keep them fresher since they aren't individually wrapped.  I don't know, but this would make some sense.<br /><br />Please, do yourself a favor and buy the individually wrapped version of these sticks.  Its worth the extra money for the freshness you get from unwrapping each stick and to not possibly experience ""issues, which will lead to buyers remorse.",Neutral
"I love the color of this shirt and the material is very lightweight.  The sized run about a size small.  The shirt sort of shapes easily to pulls.

Despite this being a huge bottle, and thinking it would last a long time, and being that it had less calories, I wasn't impressed.  You had to use 3-4 pumps to get the creamy texture, and that old vibrant French Vanilla flavor the refrigerated kind has, so you end up getting more calories and the product is used up faster, making this not a good value.  Still, this shelf stable product is a quick fix for those that have never tried the refrigerated kind. Give it a try, you might like it.  It's not bad, it's just not the refrigerated kind, which in my opinion is the best!",Neutral
I selected this product as I do not tolerate the caffeine of full bodied coffee. However I was disappointed with this product. It tastes like flavored water - no real coffee  taste.

"These arrived relatively quick, considering they were shipped from Hawaii to WV via Priority mail, however they have obviously not been placed in the coolest part of the shipment as they had some serious melting happen apparently in transit.

"I was looking for an alternative green or white iced tea powder after I realized that the Lipton brands all contained sucralose, and did not come in an unsweetened version.  I found Stash tea online and decided to try it, using stevia as the sweetener.  I bought the lemon ginger flavor.<br /><br />By comparison, I think the Lipton powdered iced tea I had been used to drinking was more like sweetened and colored fruity ""kool-aid"" for adults.  This is different.  I am having to get used to the green tea taste, and it upset my stomach a little (when I drink hot tea, I usually drink white tea, because I like the mild taste).<br /><br />I tried using only half to a third of the packet in 16 ounces of water and that worked better.  I would probably like white tea better, but Stash doesn't make any white tea in the iced tea powder mix.  Anyway I hope to get used to the taste.  Since right now I like it watered-down, it's really a good deal as far as price.",Neutral
"When I received the package just earlier today I was excited to try it out immediately. I'm already a loyal drinker of the Yamamotoyama Iced Green Tea Powder and wanted to give Stash a try, particularly the mint flavor (Yamamotoyama only has three flavors: original unsweetened, sweetened and raspberry). When I checked the ingredients of this product (ground Sencha tea and natural peppermint flavor) I already expected that this would be unsweetened (after all, mint is not sweet in the first place so if it said ""natural"", I expected it unsweetened).<br /><br />I do agree with a few people that one packet was indeed weak for a 16oz water bottle, however I could sense a bit of the mint. Maybe it would be enough for an 8oz water content, you'd need to have at least 2 or 3 packets for you to have that strong ""mint"" flavor.<br /><br />But the best thing about having purely ground green tea with nothing else on it (well in this case it has natural peppermint in it) is that you could use this as an ingredient for other treats, such as smoothies and even desserts. Just the other day I even added the Yamamotoyama unsweetened green tea powder on my Muesli hot cereal and it was delicious. I plan to do the same with this Stash mint green tea powder (I'm an experimenting foodie so doesn't hurt to try LOL) with my hot cereal and milk.<br /><br />You can even substitute milk instead of water. Ever tasted maccha green tea latte that you get from Starbucks and Jamba Juice before? Try it with this one. :)",Neutral
"This tea has an awfully light flavor. I use this powder to make green tea lattes and green tea frappes. Very tasty. I generally shake 12 ounces cold milk, 2-3 packets of this tea powder, and 1 ounce simple syrup, then pour it over ice. Tho make the frappe, I blend the same ingredients with ice, instead of pouring it over ice. It is annoying that to make a small drink I need to use 2-3 times more than expected.",Neutral
"I've had quite a few sencha powders in my time.  The Stash product is one of the best-priced products out there.<br /><br />That said, what you get per packet is a bit on the light side for mixing with 16 oz of water.  I can barely taste the tea, and I'm pretty sensitive to tea flavors.  If you get this product, keep your mixes at 8 oz of water - otherwise, it's like you're drinking a flavorless algae.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's a good product at a good price.  At proper concentrations, the flavor is good, and you can't beat the health benefits of a good sencha/green tea.",Neutral
"This coffee is ok, but nothing great, at least in my opinion..  I will not throw it away, but neither will I order any more.  It has that sharp aftertaste that I don't care for.  It isn't as strong as I expected it to be, which could be one reason for my disappointment.  If you like mild coffee and just drink coffee for effect this is a decent and well priced product.  I enjoy coffee and drink it for taste as much as effect.  The packets are easy to open, which I appreciate.",Neutral

"I really like this tea!  It has great flavor and is really easy to make.  I like it with just a tiny bit of sweetener and a wedge of lemon.  That being said, to get the amount and strength I like for my tea I have to use 2 k-cups for one cup of tea.  I usually do two 6 oz brews and it is just right.  I can go up to an 8 oz brew and still have good flavor but I want more than 8oz at a time.  For me it is just too expensive to use 2 k-cups at a time.  I have compromised with myself and still keep the k-cups around to use if I am in a hurry (or just extra lazy) but I mostly just use the tea bags of the same flavor.  I find it really isn't much more difficult or time consuming to use my keurig machine for hot water to steep a tea bag in.  The tea bags are just much more economical for me.",Neutral

I drink it black so I can easily distinguish it. I will say that it definitely gives you a major boost so if you can get by the slight bitterness it will do the trick.<br /><br />I had a cup when I first got home from work and did not notice the bitterness as much as I did in the morning and it gave me a nice pick me up. I actually watched a movie until 11:30 and did not fall asleep on the couch by 10:00 as I usually do.<br /><br />It's worth keeping around for the kick and maybe mix with my regular Starbucks House Blend but I can't see ordering it again.

"Our dog has not figured out how to use this toy.  He loves food and eats it quickly if we put it in his bowl but is not particularly curious and tends to leave things he does not see as his alone.  For instance, he will not bother an open bag of dog food if it is in the pantry and easily accessible to him.  Our dog's brother has a similar toy and figured it out with few demonstrations.  Construction seems somewhat sturdy but it has not had much use in our household to really be tested.  Filling it is a bit of a pain as you have to unscrew the screw at the top.  It's easiest done with a screwdriver.  I don't think you should have to need a screwdriver to fill food but the way this is constructed, if you don't use one, the lid remains loose. You will need a small scoop or a funnel to not make a mess filling it.",Neutral

"In light of the glowing reviews and excellent dollar-per-ounce price ratio, I bought these. It shipped quickly enough, arrived in two days, and was very well packaged. (Bravo for that)<br /><br />But the impressing stops here. If you are thinking these are $24 dollars for 5 lbs kind of quality, you would be mistaken. These are really $12 for 5 lbs. quality. The taste is bland and unflavorful. I should have listened to the other reviewer, who said he loves the Hapi brand but didn't like these. I, too, loves the Hapi brand, and most other Japanese brands. These, however, just tastes like there is something missing in the flavor!<br /><br />To be fair, this is exactly what it is called: peas flavored in wasabi. There is nothing wrong with the taste, but somehow, the Hapi brand just tastes so much better and more addictive. I can eat a whole small can of the Hapi ones in one sitting, once you pop one in your mouth you can't stop. But these ones are BLEGH. I don't know how I am ever going to finish that 5 lbs. bag. I had no idea how large a bag 5 lbs of peas would be, but it turns out it's about 3 macbook pros stacked on top of each other. That bag is HUGE!<br /><br />Anyway, this..mundane tasting wasabi pea may be healthier and more organic, I don't know. But it most certainly won't turn any nonbeliever into fans.

"I purchased this brand as I wasn't so satisfied with the Kernel Seasons cheddar cheese. The reviews convinced me that this was the best on the market. As it is the ingredients and nutritional value are EXACTLY the same, number for number, word for word.. They must be made by the same manufacturer and packaged differently. So to sum it up --I paid $10.81 for 6.14 ounces as compared to buying 6 of the Kernel Seasons which would have come to $13.57 for 17.10 ounces. Big difference, I paid almost 100% more for this product which of course isn't so great either. I feel ripped off but what can I do, you can't win em all.

"I purchased because I could no longer find the Target Archer Farms kettle corn flavor in my local store or online. This was not bad and much better than the stuff I'd purchased in my local grocery store, but not quite as good as the Archer Farms.  The only thing that was a bit of an annoyance was that it is very fine powder so it makes a mess when shaking onto your popcorn. Also the sodium is a little bit high per serving (75 milligrams per 1/4 tsp).  I wish that information had been in the description before I ordered it.  If you can tolerate the sodium this a great find and I would rate this 4 stars.  If you are watching your sodium then this may not be the product for you.  The 1/4 tsp serving size is not enough for 3 cups of popcorn.  For the sodium content & annoying messiness, I rate this 3 stars.",Neutral

"My husband and I are both gluten intolerant and we watch our salt.  The buns are easy to make and tasty but they are too salty.  The nutrition statement for this product is very confusing.  The package states that the box of mix will make four buns.  The nutrition statement, on the side of the package, states that a bun contains 140 mg sodium.  But, when you read the fine print, you can see that the nutrition statement is actually based on making 10 tiny buns from one package.  So, using the package to make four buns, each bun would actually contain 350 mg sodium.  For anybody watching their sodium, that's too much salt for one bun.<br /><br />Also, four not-very large buns from one box of mix is pretty expensive.<br /><br />I realized that there's not much else in this mix except tapioca (manioc) flour and salt.  You add your own wet ingredients and, optionally, cheese.<br /><br />My solution:  I found many recipes on the Web, in English, for manioc buns or pao de queijo which is the Brazilian name for manioc buns.  The recipes that I found are esentially the same as the instructions on the Chebe box.  I bought Bob's Red Mill tapioca flour (four 20 oz bags for about $12.00) from Amazon.  To use up my remaining boxes of Chebe mixes, to dilute the salt level, in a bowl, I emptied the box of Chebe mix, added the same amount of Bob's unsalted tapioca flour (2 cups), and double the amount of wet ingredients required just to make the mix.<br /><br />The resulting dough was stickier than the original Chebe mix, but the buns that I made were incredibly good.  They tasted similar to southern biscuits.  They were hot and steaming with an excellent texture.  I baked them in an ungreased stoneware pan and they did not stick to the pan.<br /><br />After I've finished my remaining the Chebe mixes, I'll attempt to make more buns by using the rest of my Bob's tapioca flour with the same proportions of wet and dry ingredients that the Chebe mix uses.<br /><br />I'm not an experienced baker - does anybody have any idea how to make my lower salt dough less sticky - more oil, more liquid, more flour?",Neutral

If you like your popcorn very salty, this is the product for you!  However, I don't!  I like more butter flavor and only a little salt.  It's simple enough to snip off a small corner of the popcorn side of the packet and pour out most of the salt.  Unfortunately, out of the 20 packets I bought, six of them were not separated properly and the salt and kernels mixed with the oil, so I am stuck with the six overly salty bowls of popcorn.  I really wish this company made a low salt or unsalted version of these packs.  I'd definitely buy more if I didn't have to taste all that salt!",Neutral

I was afraid it was my new popper so decided to try it in my old Stir Crazy popper.  This time there was about 1/4 of unpopped kernels but at least a full cup of poorly popped corn (tiny, tough pieces).<br /><br />So I tried some old Orville Redenbacher's I had in the pantry in the new popper.  Almost all of it popped with only about a tablespoon of unpopped kernels.<br /><br />The flavor of the Great Northern was wonderful and what DID pop was crunchy and not at all soggy.

We have purchased this popcorn twice. It's just the right amount for our popcorn popper as we have a 4 oz kettle on the stand up machine. About 95% of the corn pops so expect to lose a little but this is normal with an automatic paper as occasionally a popped grain of corn will take an unpopped grain of corn with it as it leaves the kettle. The oil in the packages in the first batch stayed firm however the oil in the second order is completely melted. We have not yet figured out the reasons as storage condition for each were exactly the same. This is a good product however you are paying a lot more than bulk ingredients when it comes prepackaged like this.,Neutral
"I've been buying this popcorn on the subscription program for the last 1.5 years. Overall, the kids absolutely love the popcorn - it tastes even better than the movies and for under $1.00 per bag, I figure I'm getting a good deal. However, one issue I have is the large number of ""Old Maid"" unpopped kernels. I haven't used other brands, so I'm not sure what is normal, but it seems that about 20% of the kernels do not pop. This is an average over 1.5 years of using the Great Northern brand in a Great Northern popcorn machine.<br /><br />If you have found a popcorn that makes a higher % of the kernels, you may want to avoid this brand, unless of course, it costs 25% more $.",Neutral
"This popcorn is not the same as movie theater popcorn. If you have ever been to target and tried the popcorn that they sell at the little target snack bar it the same as that but ten times saltier.

We purchased a large table top popcorn machine with an 8oz. kettle. It is a little difficult to squeeze the oil portion into the large kettle.  The flavor of the popcorn is quite good.

One package can easily feed 3-4 people.,Neutral

"I purchased this product for use with my new Maxi-Matic popcorn machine, with the goal of producing that movie-theater taste that none of my previous popping efforts had replicated. These portion packs succeed in that the flavor is spot-on. They might even be better than what you'd get in a theater because the flavor is so fresh when just popped.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the flavor alone doesn't make this a great purchase. As others have mentioned, the texture of the popped corn varies widely. Of four pre-portioned packages that we've popped so far, three produced stale, chewy popcorn. When we tried the fourth batch using the packaged butter salt and coconut oil with an equivalent amount of another brand's popcorn that we had on hand, it was much more tender.<br /><br />Also, if the packs are poured directly into the kettle as intended, the resulting popcorn is almost inedibly salty. Much more palatable results were produced using about half of the packaged amount. But by the time you're customizing the pour, the 'convenience' factor of these packages is shot. Not that they're very convenient, anyway - the 4 oz. portion was very difficult to transfer into our 4 oz. kettle. The bag is very big compared to the working space inside the heated kettle elements, and it's almost impossible to make popcorn without oil, salt, and kernels falling all over the place or dripping all over the bag.<br /><br />Considering the portion issues and difficulty of use, in the future I'll be buying the three components separately. I'd stick with this company's coconut oil and butter salt, but would likely get different corn.",Neutral
"My wife and I take movies and popcorn very seriously. Every Friday and Saturday night, after the kids are in bed, we turn out the lights, pop in a blu-ray, and sit down to a movie with popcorn and soda. For about a year or so we had been buying fresh popcorn locally, but the shop had closed down and we searched for a replacement on Amazon. We knew we wouldn't find popcorn as fresh, but we were mostly concerned with flavor. We bought a box of Great Northern popcorn.<br /><br />The box arrived and I was a bit concerned with the look of the oil in the packets... it didn't look like oil at all, but rather butter after you melt a solid stick and it cools and coagulates back into a solid. It was more yellow then orange, had a curdled/marbled look to it, and felt a bit stiff. I looked all over the packaging to find an expiration date, but there wasn't any. I checked the reviews and saw that people had said it was suppose to be solid, so I went ahead and tried it. Once the oil started heating up, it melted instantly, so everything seemed ok. Although the flavor was really good, the popcorn certainly wasn't very fresh. We figured that we were so use to the fresh local popcorn that we were being too overly critical of it, so we continued to make it every weekend.<br /><br />When we were almost out of popcorn packs, we bought Orville Reddenbacher popcorn and popcorn oil at the grocery store. The popcorn was MUCH fresher, but didn't taste anywhere near as good, so we bought another case of Great Northern from Amazon. This second case was completely different from the first. The oil in the packs was orange and actually looked like solidified popcorn oil. It was also much softer, almost like a gel. We popped a pack that night and was shocked at how much better it was... the popcorn was much fresher and simply fantastic.<br /><br />A few days later I found that a friend of ours had bought a box of Great Northern from another website and stopped eating it after the third pack. He said it was stale and not very enjoyable. I gave him a pack of ours and he loved it, so he's going to return the box he got and hope to get a fresher one.<br /><br />It's a shame that there aren't better quality controls with this popcorn... a simple expiration date on the outside of the case would assure that everyone gets a reasonably fresh supply. I added an image above to show the difference between a pack in our first box (old) and one from our second box (fresh). If you get an old case, I highly recommend returning it and getting a fresher case... it'll be the difference between getting a good bowl of popcorn and a Great one.<br /><br />If I had never bought a second case, I would have rated this 3 stars. The second case was definitely a 5-star rating, but due to the inability to tell how fresh the product is until you actually open it, I can't give it more then 3 stars. This is not Amazon's fault since they would have to open the boxes and have someone judge how good it looks prior to shipping. This is a pretty big issue since if it weren't for me, my friend would have tossed his case in the garbage and would have written Great Northern off as a low-quality brand.",Neutral
"When I popped the popcorn, I expected more.  But overall the taste was great, alittle on the salty side.",Neutral
This is a tough popcorn. It's not bad just not the best. I have a popper that is a dome type with a wire sweeper that goes round and round.

It is randomly spread and half of it is like air popped corn and tasteless.,Neutral

"I was concerned when I received it because of the oil being solidified.  I looked for a date on it to see if it was old product, but did not find any dates.  I tried one package to see how it tasted.  It tasted normal.  It was a little more difficult to get out of the package since I had to do just the oil first to let it melt before putting the popcorn and seasoning parts of the package in.  It would be nice if the packages were dated so that I know how long I have to use them for best results, and I'm really not sure of how old they are to begin with.<br /><br />So bottom line, I was happy with the taste, but convenience is somewhat diminished because the oil is solid.<br /><br />Added 11/28/11 - I do prefer to use less of the seasoned salt.

"Not sure if this is the fault of the popcorn, the popcorn popper or the user, but I'm having a problem with unpopped kernels. I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet.

Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over. So for my family of 5, one 8 oz package isn't really enough, but two is too much.",Neutral
"This is a pretty good product in the fact that everything is pre mesured for you.  Just cut the top and pour it in.  The only problem for me was there was waaaay to much salt.  And since it is already in the product the heat makes it stick to the popcorn so each piece has a lot of salt.  You almost need to drink a lot of water during and after you eat this.  If it had about 1/2 as much salt it would get a 5 from me, but as it is now I have to work to take the salt out when takes the ease of jsut cut and pour out of the product.  But if you like salt, its perfect for you, the best example I can think of, is that it does taste like and smell like movie popcorn, but purchase a movie popcorn and then pour about another 3 tablespoons of salt on it.",Neutral
The packaging is very convenient for the small 2.5 ounce popcorn poppers. The taste rivals movie theaters. The only negative is this is too salty. I do not know if it has to do with popcorn popper (it seems to have a large number of un-popped kernels)or just too much salt. We compensate by adding 50% more popcorn to the popper and this produces a much better product.,Neutral
This is a pretty good tea but pales in comparison to the vanilla Chai. Since they do not carry this at my local supermarkets I went with the high marks it got on Amazon reviews. I would much rather have purchased 120 packets of the vanilla chai.<br /><br />Of the Bigalow teas I have tried I would rank them as follows:<br />1. Vanilla Chai<br />2. Cinnimon stick<br />3. Vanilla Caramel<br />4. Earl grey<br />5. Green Tea with lemon<br />6. Pumpkin spice (doesn't taste or smell anything like pumpkin pie),Neutral
Thought I would love this product but found it to be rather tasteless.  I always use Vanilla Chai and love it!!  Have to use 2 teabags to get a decent flavor with the caramel.,Neutral
"The first time I had this tea, I couldn't stand it.  Had one or two teabags, mourned my purchase, and left the other 18 tea bags there.  I've just tried it again and I found it all right, so I think I can get through the rest, but it will definitely take time.<br /><br />The flavoring added to this tea is clumsy and heavy.  The tea bags themselves say ""natural & artificially flavored"" and say it has a ""rich, robust flavor"".  That's for sure.  Dunk a tea bag in a glass of unheated tap water (I drink all mine steeped in room-temperature water, never boiled) and you will watch the water immediately turn brown, whereas a higher-grade tea would need much more time to get anywhere near that coloring.  The aroma also is very artificial-smelling and way too strong compared to what naturally flavored teas smell like.<br /><br />Is this a problem?  Not necessarily.  You might be looking for a ""heavy"" tea that you can use as a step to wean your kids off of colas.  With some sugar, possibly some cream, this might be exactly what you are looking for.  In the same way this might also be a way to wean yourself off of coffee if, as a coffee drinker, you feel that teas are too ""light"".  Or you might just like your tea this way, period.  Just be aware of this when you buy it.<br /><br />I recommend the Dilmah brand, Caramel flavor, as being similar to this one but not as fakey smelling.

I have no complaints about the quality of this tea it is very good. My only complaint is that I do think it is<br />completely misleading to call it plantation mint without stating somehow that black tea (and hence caffeine) is an ingredient.<br />I am always on the look out for something tea-like to drink that does not contain caffeine. I find decaffeinated teas/coffees to taste funny and like to drink something that has not been altered to be caffeine-free. When I see plantation mint I assume that this product is  made with only mint leaves until you read the fine print on the ingredients to find black tea is in it. This is the only thing that bothers me about this product which is otherwise quite nice.,Neutral

"It's hard to describe the taste of this version of MiO (Green Thunder, originally 'Thunder Punch'). It tastes close to green apple, green Kool-Aid, or a non-carbonated green Monster energy drink. However, it's definitely better than its current counterpart Black Cherry in my humble opinion. While both have a syrup-like texture, Green Thunder is much more enjoyable. Try small amounts in clear-colored drinks such as Water, Sprite, or Sierra-Mist.<br /><br />Note, I had to dig on the internet to find the nutrient/caffeine numbers since the nutrition facts per servings are based on percentages. However, besides having zero (0) of most common facts which MiO is branded for (calories, sugar, carbs, etc.) and only 10mg of sodium, here's what I came up with for the caffeine and B-complex:<br /><br />Caffeine: 60mg (20mg less than Red Bull, and quite a few premium coffees)<br />B3 (Niacin) - 10% daily value - 1.8mg<br />B6 (Pyridoxine) - 10% daily value - 0.2mg<br />B12 (Cobalamine) - 10% daily value - 0.6µg (0.0006mg)<br />&lt;2% mixture of Taurine, Guarana Extract, and Ginseng Extract (Panax)<br />*Side Note: B-vitamin consumption and overdose is really a non-issue with over the counter mixtures. Over abundance in your system will usually be urinated out, and quite a few other energy supplements have 6000% to 8000% of daily value B-vitamins (5-hour).<br /><br />While it doesn't come too close to the effects of main stream energy supplements and drinks, it has about the same effect as a light homemade cup of coffee with B vitamins. It also doesn't add to you calorie count if you're mixing it with water during your morning and afternoon shifts at work. And furthermore, being in a convenient container, you can almost take it with you anywhere. Make sure you start out with small amounts if you're sensitive to caffeine.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite the price, I recommend trying this. Buy this flavor first (if you like the aforementioned described flavors).",Neutral
"Green apple flavor cough syrup.<br />No, that isn't a compliment.<br />It's ok, just not great.<br />It's nowhere near as bad as other drinks I've had.<br />The tiny container that it comes in rocks and I love the fact that I don't have to refrigerate it either.<br />All in all, not bad.<br />It just needs some tweaking in the taste department.<br />I'll give a halfhearted recommendation if you need to spruce up your plain water without adding more inches to your waist.",Neutral

I am giving the sorghum a three only because I did not know how or what to do with the product.  There was no instructions sent in with the product.

"I ordered this stuff in bulk, because the reviews looked so good, I had no doubt that it would be great.  Maybe I'm a little hard on it because I'm like a champion bread maker.  I was almost destroyed when I figured out gluten was causing my psoriasis.  My bread turned out mishapen and like a brick.  Just super heavy, and like week old regular bread.  Kinda crumbly.  It takes like an hour and a half to finish cooking on the inside.  I guess gluten free bread is so bad, that this is the best we could come up with.  I must say it had a nicer aroma than the other bread I tried, but I just am not impressed.  I'm going to bake another loaf, and pray that I did something wrong the first time.  I don't mean to be a ""debbie downer"", but if this is the very best out there, and I've heard that it is, I may just be giving up sandwiches all together!  I hope your bread turns out better than mine.  Is there a way to repost a review if my next loaf turns out great?  Oh well... just don't be surprised if your first loaf is a disaster, because I'm a kitchen queen, and it was no good.  P.S.  I'm vegan and had to use an egg substitute.  Maybe the secret is in the eggs?",Neutral
"I had high hopes for this gluten-free bread mix, and although it had many good qualities, I probably wouldn't buy it again because I didn't care for the flavor. I made it in my breadmaker and it rose nicely and held its shape reasonably well after I took it out of the machine. I let the bread cool before I cut it as all gluten free bread can fall if cut while hot, and the bread sliced very well. Each individual slice had a spongy, soft bread texture. Actually it was almost a little TOO soft for me, but those who like soft bread might enjoy it. I cut a slice and put margarine and honey on it, expecting to have a tasty bite of fresh bread- but something about the flavor bothered me, and I had difficulty enjoying it. I have had almost every kind of gluten-free bread on the market and have been gluten free for a long time, but I don't know how I feel about this new Sorghum craze. Although it yields decent nutritional value and good texture, similarly to bean flour, if there is too high of a ratio of sorghum to neutral flours (White rice, tapioca, etc.) I think that the flavor is negatively impacted. I prefer a more subtle mix, like Bette Hagman's four flour blend, which has less sorghum and thus gets the good qualities of the flour without negatively impacting flavor. I toasted the bread for sandwiches for a few days and my husband ate it without complaint (he is not gluten-free), but because I didn't like the bread and it reminded me a little of playdough, I don't think I'll buy it again. My entirely subjective opinion aside, if you are looking for an easy gluten-free bread mix for your machine, I would recommend that you try this mix, because only trial and error will help you find a bread mix that suits your palate. I prefer homemade bean flour blends, Bob's red Mill GF bread, or The gluten free Pantry's favorite sandwich bread, but you may find this mix fits the bill perfectly!<br /><br />One other note- Most of the 99 reviews listed for this item are actually NOT for this specific mix- they are for the full spectrum of Pamela's products on Amazon.

What a disaster.  IMPOSSIBLE to get the pie dough transferred to the pan, kept falling apart.  No way I could get the top crust on in one piece.  I ended up cutting strips.

On the other hand, if you have found Whole Foods gluten-free loaves, such as the Prairie bread with pumpkin and sunflower seeds, then I think you'll be disappointed as I was. I tried the manual mixing method, and took special care to allow the bread to rise as I would a non-GF bread. The instructions say only to let it rise 1 hr. which I believe is inadequate. Perhaps the yeast in the supplied packet was not as active as it should have been -- in any event the resulting bread did not rise properly in several attempts.

But I found the next day it was not as good, even with retoasting it in the oven.  It was very heavy and dense and had a strange bitter taste to it.  Because of the dense texture though I think this would work really well for sweet breads.  I tried using it as a pizza crust and it was just way too heavy and overpowering of more delicate flavors like cheese and mushrooms.  The flours used in this were a little hard on my tummy too.  Overall it is okay, but I am not amazed.  I would probably skip this unless I plan to use the whole loaf fresh from baking or just for sweet breads.",Neutral

"I've had raisin bran from various brands, from growing up on various cereal that popped up on sale, but I don't remember any of them having as many raisins as Kellogg's Raisin Bran! It seems every normal-sized spoonful has 5-6 raisins on average. It's enough to make me look up the health benefits of raisins, as I can't see a cereal this sweet as being very healthy. As suspected, raisins are full of calories, mainly from sugars. If you're looking for a very healthy cereal, look elsewhere. This one seems to be made for those with a sweet tooth, though I guess some may find that sweetness from raisins is better than sweetness from other ingredients (ex. high fructose corn syrup).<br /><br />My rating reflects my personal opinion and taste, more than the quality of the product. Amazon shipped them to me in a shape no worse than found at a local grocery store and the flakes are still very crisp and palette pleasing, with the sell by date 6 months away (Mar '13). It seems fresh enough. It's the ratio of raisins and flakes that bugs me; I guess I was hoping more for a bowl of Wheaties with only a handful of raisins, for 1-2 raisins per spoonful on average.<br /><br />As a warning for those who don't normally eat raisin bran, beware that this cereal is dense. 20 oz of this stuff comes in a similar sized box as some others' 10-14 oz boxes. If you eat a bowl of it, filled up the same amount as you would with something like Cheerios, this will leave you a heavy feeling in your stomach. I recommend mixing some of this cereal with some other cereal, to make it more palatable, with my favorite being Quaker Oatmeal Squares, though I imagine this goes well with many other cereals.<br /><br />Also note that these boxes currently do not have any Kellogg's Family Rewards codes, at least the three I checked do not.

"I love the taste of pop-chips but, I think it is a little too salty. The manufacturer for some reason decided that it looked,tasted too healthy and decided to add extra salt to appeal to a broad audience.<br />I think they woul've been better served keeping the salt content low.<br /><br />I would recommend the barbecue flavor which doesn't suffer from the same problem. the worst I think is the sour-cream (or something like that) flavor. This one is ok.",Neutral
I tried the BBQ first and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I have always had a weakness for Sour Cream & Onion so figured it would be heaven in the popchips calorie sized bags..<br /><br />And it arrived and just didn't have the same 'tang' as most SC&O flavors do.,Neutral
"I order these chips on a regular basis.  I like how they are portioned and one bag is only 2 points if you're doing Weight Watchers.

I was very disappointed because usually they come in safe packaging. I give the chips 5 stars, but the packaging this time around was horrible!",Neutral

"My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation ""spices"" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012",Neutral
"I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste. This wouldn't be so bad, except they taste overwhelmingly of tomato and celery. The reason they didn't call them Tomato and Celery Chips is because it is sounds gross and no one would buy that, and unfortunately it tastes like it sounds.",Neutral
"I love Pop Chips and had been odering the variety pack.  However, there were some flavors in the variety pack that I didn't particularly care for, so I decided to branch out.  This is my first time trying this flavor.  While okay, they are not as good as I had originally thought.  I'm working my way through them, but will probably not order this flavor in the future.",Neutral
"These popchips both taste and smell horrible. I was very let down as I enjoy most if not all the various flavors that popchips have to offer... besides this flavor. The smell is actually so awful that it kills it from the start. If you could manage to eat them after that, well good on you. As for me I am dissatisfied with this flavor in specific. I would still recommend popchips as a whole.",Neutral
I love sweet potatoes. They are a nutritional powerhouse and great for diabetics. I eat them in a variety of dishes to stay lean and fit. I also love chips. Imagine my dismay when I thought the best of both worlds (sweet potato chips ) ended up tasting not much like either of those things. I ate three bags on different days and on an empty stomach just to make sure I wasn't mistaken. Not even my pit bull would touch these (he's a bit of a snob though). These just sit on the cupboard (on death-row) awaiting their expiration date .,Neutral
"These chips are a great idea! Nice potato flavor with a satisfying crunch. But . . . . waaaaaay tooooo salty. I literally had to blow off the salt to be able to taste any potato flavor! I've tried the 'sour cream and onion' flavor, and that was fine. Just too much salt on the 'regular' flavor.",Neutral
i usually love spicy chips... but somehow don't find these appealing... next time i think i will try the plain ones first! these are light and crunchy...,Neutral
"I love Pop chips- have tried many flavors and enjoyed them due to the low calorie count and they satisfy my craving for salt! With that said, I was so excited when I heard Pop Chips had come out with a Jalapeno Chip!<br />I am sad to say the Jalapeno chip just misses the mark. Both my husband and I agreed there is something off about them and seeing as we usually love other kinds of jalapeno chips, these were just not good. Save your money, don't get the jalapeno chips flavor.",Neutral

I think if they had been a different flavor, then maybe I would have liked them more.  But everytime I ate them, the chili powder threatened to bring on an asthma attack.<br /><br />Next time I'm trying the Vinegar and Sea Salt!",Neutral
i dont get the big deal. First of all they are not nearly as delicious as regular chips so they dont even satisfy the same chip craving in me. They taste okay but slightly carboardy styrofoamy - i.e qualities that you do NOT want in a chip,Neutral
"I have to agree with the recent reviews, these are just so so as far as taste.  I bought them as a lightning deal special thinking these would be a little healthier and keep me away from the Kettle chips that I love...after eating a bag of these, I want the Kettle chips back.  They are ok but not as good as a fried chip.  Maybe eating these will discourage me from chips period.  Like some other people making comments, I'll probably finish the box and not buy again.  They remind me of Pringle chips just smaller and maybe a little puffier.",Neutral
"I bought the BBQ flavor.  From time to time you want some chips with a sandwich, or maybe just a salty snack.  The BBQ flavoring is good, but these chips are not as good as fried chips.  Frankly they don't taste good enough to keep my attention as a stand-alone snack.  I eat a few then lose interest.  I'll probably use them as a side with a sandwich.",Neutral
"I've tried some of the other pop chips flavors - and they have MUCH more flavor. My kids, however, absolutely love these and since they're so much healthier than potato chips (I hope) I'll probably just continue ordering them.",Neutral
I absolutely LOVE the BBQ popchips.  They are my favorite but when I saw they had Chili Lime I thought that would be even better. Not so much. I purchased an entire box of 12 of the 3oz bags and wish I would have just stuck to my BBQ.,Neutral
"At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",Neutral
"As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",Neutral
"Normally I prefer plain chips, even though I don't eat them often. The chili lime is pretty good, great with some guacamole. These chips are very crisp, with a strong potato flavor, but also have a slightly burnt taste.",Neutral
"I used to think these were basically ""potato crack"" but they have changed the way they process them with my last batch.  They seemed flat and overcooked.  Hopefully, things will get back to normal with the next order.",Neutral
"BBQ was out-of-stock when our subscription order was due, so I tried these. Still light and less fatty, but the flavor is off.",Neutral
"I accidentally bought these chips (thought I was getting original pop chips), but have to say, because they are a little tart, I don't seem to be eating them as quickly, (good for my diet!).  If you like the taste of vinegar, you will like these.",Neutral
"These are definitely a healthier alternative than your standard potato chip - each bag (roughly 20 silver dollar-sized chips) has only three grams of fat and 100 calories. They are also kosher, gluten-free and vegan.<br /><br />Instead of baking the flavor into the chip, Popchips add seasoning once the chips are ""popped"" (as opposed to fried or baked). This, however, is also the cause of my problem with the chips. I found the flavor to be wildly inconsisent from bag to bag, and sometimes from chip to chip within the same bag. One bag's lime flavor was so overpowering I almost gagged, while the next was a nice, uneventful snack. The lime flavor is also much, much more noticeable than the chili flavor.<br /><br />As a healthy alternative to potato chips, these are a viable option, but keep a glass of water handy - with the almost-randomized flavor intensity, you're not going to know how intense the lime flavor is going to be until you open the bag.",Neutral
"I love Pop Chips. Parmesan Garlic and Sour Cream and Onion Pop Chips rock my world. They taste great, have a quirky crunch and are low cal/fat (in relation to traditional chips).<br /><br />Sadly though I must base this review on the Chili Lime flavor I was sent through the Amazon Vine program. These are probably my least favorite flavor to date. They have the lime twang you would expect and a little chili heat (though not overly spicy) and even the potato flavor comes through. Individually these all work but somehow in this chip they really don't. Interestingly enough the aftertaste is actually better than the intial flavor of the chip itself.<br />I'm not saying this flavor is bad, it's just not that good.<br /><br />Overall, great brand with great flavors in general but Chili Lime doesn't stack up against the others.",Neutral
"I have a bag of Popchips everyday with lunch. So needless to say I love Popchips. When I saw a new flavor available on Amazon of course I had to try it. Chili Lime sounded interesting, and it is indeed an interesting flavor. There is a big hint of lime along with the ""chili"" flavor which is hard to explain. I think this is one of those things that you just have to try for yourself if it sounds interesting. They're decent enough that I will finish off the box, but I can't say I would buy this flavor again.",Neutral
"I ordered this box of potato chips a few months ago. I love the popchips, it tastes great.<br />One thing I have problem is it's little too salty for me. Anyone who has less tolerance of salt should be careful.",Neutral
"I like that it's not greasy and has less calories, but it's a little salty side, and it doesn't taste like potato chips I'm used to. It tastes like rice cakes with a hint of potato flavor (I guess that's how 'pop'things taste like). I like that it's less of a guilty pleasure, but I don't think I will buy it again.",Neutral
"They're ok, but not much flavor in the Sea Salt & Vinegar flavor. I might try the multigrain flavor.",Neutral
"I am totally addicted to POPCHIPS!  This is a very plain flavor, but tasts ok - it is not my favorite but I can eat them.  It tates better than a plain chip - not greasy or anything.  Around 100 calories and 3 grams of fat is still a very good snack, in my opinion.  I would buy these again.",Neutral
"I am surprised just how yummy these chips are and my kids ADORE them. They have no artificial anything which is important as my kids are on the Feingold diet which eliminates all artificial coloring, preservatives, and flavors. The only thing that kept me from a higher star rating is the choice of oil they used to coat the chips. I have NO PROBLEM with oil as I believe fat is GOOD for us and the great thing is they coat the chips with oil AFTER they heat them so they don't create free radicals. That said, the ingredient list says, ""sunflower, safflower, and/or canola oil."" Hmmmm... that's not very definitive!<br /><br />Sunflower and safflower oil are good but canola is a FRANKENFOOD that I don't want my kids to eat. Sigh... a yummy possibility spoiled by canola oil.",Neutral
"After sampling a bag of Pop Chips, I was excited about buying a large box from Amazon and stocking up on these healthy but tasty snacks. The chips themselves are a bit airy and they kind of dissolve in your mouth after you crunch into them, and they pack a lot of flavor! However, after the first couple of bags, I found the flavor was overwhelming and that the aftertaste was a bit too salty for my taste. The product itself is good, but the quantity was just too much for our household! Be sure you can eat 12 bags of these chips before they go stale, or just stick to buying one bag at a time at your local grocery store.",Neutral
"I had to fight to open the sweet potato chip bag because my mind just doesn't want me to be eating sweet potato chips.  Anyway...I get the bag open and I expected them to be gross.  The chips are not gross. They taste like sweet potatos which to me means they need some butter flavor added  to make them taste good.  As it stands, they taste like an unflavored bake potatoe without any butter.<br /><br />I tried to eat a whole bag and they kept getting stuck in my teeth so I gave up.  Also, it just doesn't feel right to be eating sweet potato chips.  I have a whole box of them so I am going to continue to try to get used to them.<br />====<br /><br />Update: I still have a box of these chips left.  I couldn't stomach them, my co-workers said they were too bland, and my friend co-worker said they taste like unflavored cornflakes.<br /><br />I don't see how these will be a hit in stores.",Neutral
"I thought these were going to be sliced sweet potato's, but they are not part of the ingredients. It's actually sweet potato flour. In addition, there is rice flour and corn flour mixed in. I think the taste of the corn flour overpowers the sweet potato flavor. Overall, the chips taste like salty corn flakes with a hint of sweet potato.  Overall, probably fairly healthy for what they are (low in fat), but short on taste. If you are not expecting a strong sweet potato flavor, then these may be a good choice for you.",Neutral

"Mixed reviews for this product. Some people liked it very much, some of them hated it. When i first tried it, they tasted horrible. But somehow I liked it when i had them the next time. Very light, flavored, spicy. The texture on the chips look good, but the after taste is not that great. That was my review. But a couple of my colleagues liked them so much that they had 2 bags of it at once. they loved the taste, flavor and also the after taste. 100 cal per bag with 0 cholesterol, not a bad bet!",Neutral
"I normally love Popchips.  I couldn't find them in the local stores so I ordered them here.  The flavor doesn't seem as good... they are a little more browned,thinner and seemed more crispy in a harder sort of way.  I don't know if the batch was off or if they have changed how they make them.  I was disappointed.",Neutral

"The seasoning is too heavy. I will eat them, but only because I ordered a bunch.",Neutral
"I shared these with friends at work.  The consensus is that they taste good, if not quite what some people expected.  Those who enjoy sweet potato fries liked them better than those with no experience in that area.  Price would be a consideration for everyone who tasted these, but not necessarily the overriding issue.  I personally enjoy them.  I'd look for them in a larger bag over a snack-size bag, mostly because I'm cheap that way.  Nobody said they were nasty or that it was something they'd never choose.",Neutral
"In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.",Neutral
"NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're ""probably"" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a ""tomato"" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like ""Tomato and Basil"" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",Neutral

"Due to food allergies this pancake mix had all the ingredients I was able to have.  I liked the fact that all you needed to make these pancakes was water.  No need to add eggs,milk etc which I am unable to eat.  I read the reviews, so I figured sounds good give it a try.  I really should have tried 1pkg but because I ordered through amazon I had to get 6pkg.  Which really stinks. The taste to me was only so so.  I did add only cinnamon, since my food allergies. Perhaps thats the reason the taste was only so so.  I did not think it was sweet like another reviewer said.  But I was not going to eat them with syrup.  My complaint is that no matter how long I cooked them they always seemed raw inside.  I would not order this kind again.",Neutral
"This mix makes wonderful crispy on the outside tender on the inside waffles however they were so sweet that by the time you put syrup or any other topping on it they get so sickeningly sweet you can hardly eat them.  Its like they put in too much vanilla or something.  To me the whole point of a waffle or pancake is that they be more of a plain base that compliments whatever toppings you choose to put on them.  They shouldn't compete with the flavor of the toppings.  With these being so sweet already it was just way too much.  Seriously, you could just butter and eat them with no additional topping.  Will continue to look for something more akin to original waffles and pancakes.",Neutral

It honestly tastes like a hot chocolate with a tiny bit of spice added. I can taste a hint of clove, ginger and some cinnamon. The sugar in this mix is ridiculous. I tried to make it with half the directed amount and am left with little flavor, I tried to make it with double the amount and I am accosted with sweetness.<br /><br />Maybe next time I will try the spicy chai by Big Train. If that's a bust, I will never try this brand again.",Neutral
"First, let me say that I LOVE the taste of this chai.  It is my favorite chai and until I bought these two huge cans, it was something I enjoyed every couple of weeks when I was out shopping.  Knowing how expensive it is to order from a coffee shop, I thought it would be better to just make it myself.<br /><br />Making it at home, I use milk instead of water and only use about half of the recommended scoop.<br /><br />Once I got the cans, I looked at the list of ingredients.  Sugar is number one on the list and each serving has 24 grams of sugar in it.  (That's almost 70% of each scoop.)<br /><br />As others have mentioned, it definitely has caffeine in it.  One 8 ounce cup of this prepared chai has about as much caffeine as two 12 ounce cans of Coke.  After a short while, I noticed that the caffeine was starting to affect me- by way of headaches.  I don't really understand the company's claim of being 99.8% caffeine free when clearly it is not.<br /><br />While I think the flavor is great, I won't buy this again due to the caffeine and sugar content.",Neutral
"A pretty good mix, I just don't like that it has so much sugar in it, but that is just me. Taste pretty good for an occasional treat.",Neutral
These were just ok.  They were perfect for my strawberry shortcake party for my daughters 1st birthday but the favor wasn't that great.,Neutral
"Although this tea is flavorful and tastes fine, I should have read the description more carefully. I was looking for pure licorice root tea. This tea has other spices added to it and the orange peel flavor is dominant and licorice flavor is muted. I am giving it three stars because the name of the tea should include some of the other spices. Read the ingredients listed before you purchase. Here is the description, ""Combined with a touch of cinnamon, orange peel and other carefully selected herbs and spices"" If you like these other spices then you will be happy. Otherwise, you might opt for a pure licorice tea and the box will say, ""Ingredients: Licorice Root"". That was what I really wanted, although this tea tastes perfectly good.",Neutral
So I bought this tea thinking it was the same as the Thai tea that is served at Thai Restaraunts but its not. This tea is very coconutty which theres nothing wrong with that but its not the same restaraunt type if thats what youre looking for. You should buy this tea if youre looking for a cinnamon/coconut exotic tea.,Neutral
maybe i've just had way too many other bars. perhaps i've been spoiled by the best but these are super boring in my opinion. there's just no flavor!!,Neutral
"MY DOGS LOVED IT FOR THE TASTE, I THINK. AND IT DID SEEM TO BE SOMETHING THAT THEY ENJOYED CHEWING ON. MY ONLY PROBLEM WAS THE TITLE SAYS EVERLASTING TREAT FOR DOGS. WHICH I TOOK TO MEAN LAST A VERY, LONG TIME, BUT IT ONLY LASTED ABOUT 1 HOUR. BUT IT WAS STILL A GREAT TREAT FOR MY DOGS. WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.",Neutral
"My 2 year old inteligent Red Heeler had this treat out of the puzzle ball and devoured in about 25 minutes.  However, my 12 year old ""not that smart"" Chow mix couldn't get the treat out of the puzzle and licked the treat for hours, until the Red Heeler got a hold of it.  So, if you have a ""not so smart"" dog this is a good product.  But if your dog is smart it's not worth the price.",Neutral
"Update:  Sadly, my pup figured out how to get this treat out of the holder.  He chews with his back jaws and is able to flatten it pretty quickly and then somehow gets it out.  This used to last a day or two but is now only good for an hour or two.  If your dog is not a problem-solver, it can still be a good product but if he figures things out, then it quickly becomes a very expensive 1-2 hour event.<br /><br />Previous Review:  My young dog is an aggressive chewer when it comes to toys (not people!).  He can deconstruct almost any kind of stuffed toy and he can EAT any size of rawhide treat.  Rawhide is a disaster for him because he chews off big chunks and then swallows them.  The rawhide doesn't digest well and the big dummy gets diarrhea.  I was actually worried he was going to get an intestinal blockage from rawhide so we banned the rawhide when we found this product.<br /><br />It is very hard to get the discs into the rubber treat ball.  I have to stand on them and even then they don't seat in very properly.  However, the dog has an equally difficult time getting the treats OUT.  He has to chew sort of sideways on this rounded treat using his back molars.  They must be tasty too because he keeps working on these and they last for days.<br /><br />We will continue to buy this product.  It keeps our pup busy, seems agreeable to his stomach, and compares very favorably to other chewy treats.",Neutral
this i believe is a great dog treat the only problem is i have yet to find a toy that will outlast the treat the toys designed to use with these treats seem to be made of a soft rubber that my dog chews into pieces the treats seem to keep him busy better then the toys themselves I gave this 3 stars because it is a good treat just has no use if the toys designed for them cant keep up I would suggest a ever-locking treat for a good chew treat for your pooch,Neutral
"I have actually stopped buying these because they are so hard to insert.  I had to use a screwdriver to get it into the toy!  Even my husband had problems getting it into the toy.  We have 2 of these toys-a large one and a smaller one-and the smaller one has already been chewed on by one of our dogs.  Our big dog lost interest after the first couple of times and I just gave up on them.  They do keep the dogs busy, but 20 minutes to insert one treat seems a little too time consuming.",Neutral
"If the treat would stay in the toy for awhile it would be fine (which it would the first couple times I used the toy) but the toy must stretch a bit or something because now my pup can get them right out and it's gone chomp, chomp.  So after I use these up I'll probably not buy them anymore and just let him get the little treats out of the middle of his toy.",Neutral
Great if the dog doesn't get the treat out of the ball when its first inserted...Hard to insert so it amazes me how the dog can achieve the task of getting the treat out of the ball when new...Like the buy three deal and get the fourth free...,Neutral
"I bought this for my 2 indoor only cats. The price was very good at the time for what seemed to be decent quality food for the price. It arrived super fast with Prime shipping. I was very impressed that the 15 pound bag had a very sturdy resealable zipper to help reduce the food going stale or needing to put it in a storage container.<br /><br />Unfortunately though, my cats would just not eat this food. I had bought it on a whim since money was tight and I was trying to save a few bucks. I filled up the self feeding container for the cats and they just would not touch it..the food just sat and sat, for literally a week. They had nibbled at it now and then, but did not eat as they do with their regular food. It was like they would eat just a few pieces and that was it.<br /><br />Luckily, one of the cats prefers wet food anyway, so she was still eating daily, but the other cat does not eat wet food and just refused to eat this Good Life Recipe. I was hoping she would come out of being stubborn, or would just get so hungry that she would eat it, but no such luck. I ended up buying our regular food after it was apparent that she would not eat this replacement.<br /><br />A few years back, when this cat food first came on the market, I had received a sample bag of it in the mail. At that time I had another cat who has since passed away, and he ate it just fine. I assume it has a particualr taste or smell that just does not appeal to certain cats. I will say that this food does have a strong smell and oddly enough it sort of reminds me of vomit. This could very well be the reason that some cats do not take to it.<br /><br />Since getting our regular cat food, I tried mixing it half and half with this Goodlife recipen so that I would not be wasting an entire 15lb bag, and the cats would still not eat it. I added more of the regular food, maybe 75/25 and now they seem to be eating it since there is more of the Iams than Goodlife. I will keep mixing it with that ratio so that it does not go to waste.",Neutral
"This Walkers Premium shortbread selection is a huge tin of shortbread cookies. Luckily, they are wrapped in many packages, so they can stay fresh longer. If one is absolutely in love with shortbread cookies, I suppose this would be a good gift. Personally, I thought it was too much shortbread cookies. There are four different ones, but they all taste the same to me. I served them up to a bunch of kids and they didn't like them. I thought they were okay, but I wasn't in heaven over them and certainly don't have a craving for them. They are very buttery, but I find them bland and flavorless. I guess maybe that's what shortbread cookies are all about. These were a gift to my husband. I don't think I'd go out of my way to buy them. I'm not too embarrassed to serve them to guests, so that's how we'll get rid of them. Not bad, but not great.",Neutral
"This flavored tea sounded more delicious than it actually is. It has a definite fruit flavor, but not especially pomegranite -- more of a ""perfumey"" essence.  It is not undrinkable, but is not a my favorite. I have been adding honey to it which makes it more palatable.",Neutral

"While I usually like Nell's products and buy a wide variety of them, this product falls short.  The little candies are very inconsistent in texture, ingredients and flavor.  It's like they didn't stir the batch enough, or it settled or something.  One will melt in your mouth and not have much flavor and the next will be rock hard, but have more of the ginger ""snap"" that I look for.  The Altoid brand is better: more flavor, and more consistent.",Neutral
"Recenly purchased a 6 pack of these cookies because my 3 year old loves oreo's and had recently bought Country Choice at a local health food store and loved those.  Found Newman-O's to be a few dollars cheaper and figured they would taste pretty much the same as the other organic brand.  Next time I'll pay the extra money for Country Choice Organic chocolate sandwich cookies.  I do like the fact that Newman's cookies are organic and have no trans-fat, but they lack a bit when it comes to taste.  We'll finish our 6 pack but won't buy these again when there are other organic cookies out there.",Neutral

"My 4 month old American Eskimo started eating this brand about two weeks ago and in the last several days I've noticed her stool very loose and smelly. Not only that, she farts! She does like the food. I give her 1/4 cup in a cloth pouch she likes to eat out of instead of a bowl. On occasion, I've mixed some of the Avoderm canned food with her dry kibble. I'm a little disappointed with the gas and loose stool. Before Avoderm, she didn't care for Iams Puppy, Wellness SuperMix Puppy, or Halo Spot Puppy... she would eventually eat those when she was starving but the Avoderm she likes! When she finishes this 4.4 lb bag, I'm going to start her on a different brand that might be better for her to digest. Or maybe her stomach will adjust??",Neutral
"I was impressed with the service (price) and speed of delivery - but disappointed when half of the cans in the case arrived severely dented.

"I've bought this pumpkin before but cannot find canned pumpkin in the grocery store during non-holiday periods, for some reason.  Although the consistency is not as nice as Libby's pumpkin - this is a little watery, the fact that it's organic scores big points.  I mix it with my dog and cats foods, so the wateryness is not an issue.  My complaint is that it was not well packed for shipping.  Almost half the cans were damaged to a point that I would not have purchased them in the grocery store.  The contents seem to be fine, but I will try to find some other source next time, as the shipping seems to be a consistent issue in other reviews I have read for this product.",Neutral

I usually buy this at our local Whole Foods or Harris Teeter it's a great product but when I ordered it from Amazon all but 2 out of 12 cans arrived dented. Amazon quickly replaced the order but in the replacement case 9 cans were dented. That is really unacceptable. They did refund my $ but I really want the pumpkin so I am going to try one more time and order it again and see if I can get a case of undented cans.,Neutral
"This product is really good pureed pumpkin, but I have a problem with the cans.  I took out one can from the outside of the case to make pumpkin bread.  It is wonderful pumpkin...dark orange, tasty, full of pumpkin goodness.  However, a few days later I removed the rest of the cans from the case to put them in my cupboard.  From the middle row, right in the middle of the case, there was one can that was SO badly damaged, that I am afraid to use it for fear of me and my family getting sick from bacteria.  Now, please tell me how a can that is SO badly damaged, packed in the middle of a case, can go unnoticed by the person who is packing the case???  Or, are you that big a company that you have automation packing these cases, and it is just a strange coincidence that the only dented can ended up EXACTLY in the middle? I feel the can was placed there intentionally so that I would not notice, nor would Amazon (the shipper), no matter what side of the case it was viewed from.  Folks, we are not stupid, and we will get to that middle can eventually, so you are not hiding anything.  As the end user of this product, I feel that this can of pumpkin should have been caught at packaging and thrown in the trash...just as I have to do.  It's all about quality control.  This has raised the price per can by about .25 cents.  That means that instead of me paying $2.36 per can, I have now paid over $2.60 per can.  You have a great product, but I have a problem with a company who tries to pull the pumpkin over it's customer's eyes. Pumpkin is WAY to hard to come by right now and I was happy to have found your product on Amazon.  But, it has turned out to not be such a deal when I have to even throw away one can of pumpkin.  I give you a five star rating for your pureed pumpkin, but I deducted two stars for the wasted can.",Neutral
"I was hesitant to order this because of the recurring complaint of damaged cans, but then noticed that those reviews seem less recent, and it looks like the shipping issue was resolved (I selected the ""Amazon Frustration-Free"" packaging).  The cans arrived in perfect condition, before their use-by date, etc.<br /><br />However, the texture of the pumpkin seems a bit off. We add the pumpkin to our dogs' food. Before buying this product, we typically used the large can of Libby's brand. The texture of this product is much firmer than the canned Libby's we were using, and it even looked like there was some congealed fat in the ""Farmer's Market"" can, which seems odd for pumpkin. Another difference is that it doesn't seem to be firming up our dogs' poop like the Libby's pumpkin did (sorry if TMI!). We will probably stick with Libby's once we finish the cans from this order.",Neutral
The product does exactly what it says for my dog.  However I have found/used other products that were just as effective for half the cost.,Neutral

"I HAD to have pumpkin for my dogs so I rolled the dice after reading the mixed, but mostly dissatisfied reviews. One third of the cans were very dented. However, none were bulging which is the sign of spoiled food. We are using the dented ones first without issue - on the third of four right now.<br />I must agree that it looks like a manufacturers ""error"". The dented cans were hidden in the middle of the case, surrounded by good cans. I would bet my last dollar that Farmers Market Foods is using Amazon to dump what they knew wouldn't sell on the supermarket shelves!<br />Lastly, I will purchase this item again, dents or no dents and use it unless it's bulging.

Libby's canned pumpkin, the brand I've used my entire life, does not have this issue.<br /><br />I already cooked with one of the non-dented cans. The color is different than what I'm used to, it's more of a dirty orange-sepia color, and the texture seems a bit thicker, but it tastes fine.<br /><br />My order also had a long expiration date, 2013.<br /><br />(FYI The packaging consisted of a large box containing a smaller box of cans with bags of air to keep it from rattling.

"Pre-maid pudding seems to come in a couple of varieties.  The really good kind that makes you glad the cups are small, and the not-so-good kind that makes you long for the kind your mother used to make.  This pudding falls in the second category.  This pudding is okay on an occasional basis, but the chocolate flavor seems a little off.  It is difficult to describe what I mean, but the flavor just does not quite have the power of home-made chocolate pudding.<br /><br />I have tasted a number of other pre-made puddings, and several of them are very good.  The vanilla and the tapioca are generally very good to excellent.  The lemon is also very good.

"My one complaint is the package clearly indicates the pasta cooks quickly...in 8-9 minutes. Well, I've prepared it twice now and both times took a minimum of 20 minutes to get the middle to soften up. Keep that in mind when making dinner because it definitely is not going to cook nearly as fast as the bag indicates.<br /><br />On a positive note, the product tastes fairly good. It also works well as a cold pasta for salads and, of course, the fact that it is gluten-free is a healthy choice for those with gluten intolerance.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars because it's a middle-of-the-road review for me.

"Jimmy Dean Country Gravy / B000H153W2<br /><br />I bought this gravy mix because I do prefer to buy bulk online and my `usual' brand wasn't available on Amazon, but I have mixed feelings about the results.<br /><br />For what it's worth, there's no sausage flecks in the actual mix, so that picture on the front is just a serving suggestion. The taste is... okay. Nothing to really write home about, and often I feel like it is just too salty for my tastes. The texture also starts to feel rather gummy after you remove the pan from the heat. I do like that this packet makes a small serving - one cup of mix instead of the usual 2-3 cups that a lot of packets have, which invariably gets wasted at our table. There's also no roux/dissolving step - you just toss the water/milk in a pan, mix the packet in, and you're done - and I've had no clumping issues that aren't immediately solved with a little whisking. It's certainly VERY convenient, but I do think the taste suffers a little as a result.<br /><br />I think when these are gone, I'm going to keep trying other brands.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll",Neutral
"First thing's first: The taste. It tastes sort of like generic cough syrup, minus the medicine-like taste (if that makes sense). It doesn't taste like any other energy drink I've ever had before. So it's unique in that regard. It's not necessarily a good thing, though. I would have to say that as far as taste goes, I would not recommend it.<br /><br />Secondly, the ""spicy, burn your throat"" gimmick. It's just that, a gimmick. It doesn't taste spicy so much as it just makes your throat itch. I assume that the slight ""spicy"" feeling comes from the drink being cold, but if drank warm I'd assume it would taste like camel urine. All it really did was kind of annoy me, it didn't really add to the experience. Not that I was looking for the real cocaine experience. *wink wink*<br /><br />Thirdly, while it has a high amount of caffeine, it didn't give me quite the kick I was expecting. It woke me up a little, but it didn't do much else. But then again, I drink energy drinks like water so I have a high tolerance. Though I would not recommend it to others, if you value your health.<br /><br />My girlfriend said that the caffeine effected her more than it did me. She got more of an energy boost without the jittery feeling you may get with supplements such as 5-Hour Energy. She said that she enjoyed the flavor of the drink, so you have a second opinion there. She said that she had experienced the taste combination of cinnamon and strawberry. She enjoyed the ""spicy""-ness of it but agrees that it wasn't as strong as expected. Even though she liked it, she would only be interested in buying this again if more cans were added or the price was lowered.<br /><br />Now, here's where I would have to suggest not buying this product. Whether I liked it or not. It is TOO. *BLEEP*ING. EXPENSIVE. About $30 (including shipping) for six 8.4 fl oz (250ml) cans. You're better off buying something like the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NCTXZY"">Power Horse BIG 16 Energy Drink, 16-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>. It costs about the same, maybe a couple bucks more, and you get 24 16 fl oz cans. And in my opinion, it gives you more of a boost, tastes better, and you get more for your money. It's a cheap alternative to the more well-known energy drinks (i.e. Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster, etc.).<br /><br />All in all, mediocre experience, mediocre drink, too costly. NOT. WORTH. IT.

"Nice kit and fermenation went well and the wine finished nice and dry, but it has not so subtle anise charater that is not suited to a patio white wine. Not sure if this is a charaterisic of this appellation or what, but I will order the New Zealand kit next time. I keg, rather than bottle, the wine so I have the flexibility of pouring one glass or one liter and it does mix nicely, so I see a lot of sangrias this summer.",Neutral
"I just didn't like this flavor.<br /><br />I have found that the coffee from Donut Shop tends to actually be quite fresh for a pre-ground product.  I have no complaints there.  However, this is my first chocolate offering from Donut Shop, and it really has an unrefined, pure cocoa flavor.  That might be just the ticket for a lot of conisseurs, but I'm not much of a chocolate fan.  And to me, the pure cocoa added a really bitter bite to anotherwise smooth coffee.",Neutral
"It was somewhat thirst quenching, but I was not totally satisfied. Maybe it was because the 8.5 oz. size seems like less than I want after I really work out. Maybe it was because the coconut guava flavor (both are flavors which I actually love) seemed super watered down...they should have added more guava! The upshot? I just felt this product fell a bit short on all counts. If I get it for free on bike to work day, I won't turn up my nose, but I wouldn't buy it when there are other options.",Neutral
"I had purchased this product previously and I was very pleased with the taste. I thought it wouldn't taste very good, but after a few days I found myself craving it during the day. I use it after my daily workout to replenish electrolytes and it seems to work great. However, I was very disappointed when I went to re-order. It previously cost my $15 and now they want $25 for the same thing. I had to go to an external website to purchase it for $15. This is very disappointing to me, since I prefer to do my online shopping on Amazon. Also, they took away the Subscribe & Save feature on this. Not happy...",Neutral

"This is literally the first ""real"" maple syrup our family ever tried.<br />It was a good deal on Amazon, and I'm always looking for more natural choices to feed my family.  Overall, I like it.<br />My kids and hubby, however, have their reservations.  It is much thinner than standard ""syrup"" their used to, and the Grade B definitely has a strong maple flavor.  So if you like that, this is the syrup for you.<br /><br />Once this is all used up (I plan on baking with it as well), I plan on re-ordering the same brand,<br />only the Grade A.  Maybe that will ease them into true maple syrup a little easier!<br /><br />All in all, a great price and good syrup.  My family just isn't quite ready for the strong maple kick!  Three (and a half) stars.  Minus one star for super strong maple flavor and 1/2 star for too thin of consistency (for my tastes).  Best part is, the ingredient label!  If you force your picky husband to review his current imitation syrup in comparison to this, he'll be shocked.  100% pure maple syrup vs. Corn syrup, sugar, imitation flavorings/colorings, etc...  Go natural - buy real syrup!",Neutral
"Well, obviously one would want to buy the best, and I started scouring for Grade C, which is not available in retail anymore according to this website: [...]<br />This wasn't mentioned in the top reviews, and I don't know if someone did later...<br /><br />So I buckled and settled for this....will update the stars once I taste it...",Neutral
"Having grown up in sugar maple country and bought syrup from the farmers in unmarked gallon cans ('store syrup' never entered our house), I have plenty of experience with maple syrup.  [Tip:  maple trees and maple syrup are 'organic' by definition.  Farmers who tap trees add nothing.  Don't pay more for 'organic'.]  At our house we 'sugared off' every Winter.  For those who know what I'm talking about, read on.  For those who don't have any idea, you may be happy with this product.<br /><br />The Good:  This syrup is priced right (purchased at $17.31).  It is a good buy and you should not be shy at purchasing.  It's really about a 3 star minus or 2.5 stars.<br /><br />The Not So Good:  Grade B syrup is normally 'mapley' with caramel notes.  This syrup LACKS the strong maple flavors that make it suitable for cooking or a good match for those who like strong flavors, but it does NOT have the complexity or finesse of a Grade A Amber.  In short it is rather bland and pedestrian for maple syrup.  What we don't know is whether the trees tapped for this label vary from year to year but this batch is uninteresting.  I bought it as an alternative to Whole Foods label (about $20) but quite frankly the Whole Foods Grade A Amber has a stronger maple flavor with more complexity and the Whole Foods Grade B is significantly stronger in flavor.  I would rate the Whole Foods Grade A Amber as a 4 star minus, and the Grade B as 4-5 stars.",Neutral
"I tried Coombs syrup just after Highland Farms and before Chafee Farm's. Coombs had a mildly unpleasant burnt caramel taste that I didn't care for in comparison, though it was fine used in recipes.",Neutral
"I like this Grade B product more than the Grade A product because of the stronger flavor.  Being organic, it is quite expensive.  My husband was shocked when he saw the size of the small jug.  Nonetheless, I am hoping my children are protected as much as possible from all the chemicals out there, though the degree of protection will be limited by the amount of chemical leachables from the plastic bottle.  I was disappointed that the packaging is not glass.  The product itself is very runny.  I am starting to believe that this is just the way natural syrup is.",Neutral
"I'll review strictly based on product design since others have commented on taste. After pouring the syrup, we always notice syrup running down the sides of the bottle. I'm many months removed from the mainstream packaged ""syrup-type"" substances, but some type of spout would be beneficial. We have to wipe down the bottle after each use... *sigh*",Neutral

"These are okay, but like other reviewers have mentioned dogs need to be monitored while chewing these. These are essentially rawhide, so they eventually get very soft and pliable, and dogs who tend to gulp food/treats may try to swallow these. My recommendation for the most effective care (albeit one of the more difficult solutions) would be brushing daily.",Neutral

A little disappointing. I was hoping that the premium chews would be more like the ones I used to get. They were much thicker and lasted longer. It seems everyone is cheapening their product for the sake of the almighty dollar.,Neutral
My lab/border collie mix loves these.  She's a chewer so I can leave her with one of these when I leave which keeps her busy.  Great deal too - half the price than from the vets office. Update 4/4/11 - I ordered another bag of chews and the quality is inconsistent.  This bag had no Chlorhexidine coating on the chews so my dog wont eat them.  Returning and getting from Entirely Pets in the hopes that these will be better.,Neutral
"My dog loves these treats and begs for them.  The only problem is the irregular thickness of these treats.  Some are 3 times as thick as others.  When my dog eats the thick ones, she ultimately throws them up.  I continue to buy them because she loves them, but I hate throwing out the thick ones as expensive as these are per treat.  I wish they had better quality control.",Neutral
Vet recommended for dental health. Cost on line was half that in vets office. Product does not store well once dog has chewed on it.,Neutral
"I got this product hoping that my dog will have something good to chew every day. But 15 min (if not less) after eating the chew, my dog had a diarrhea. Amazing! Never seen anything work so fast in that direction. So I had to take him out for a walk every 30 min that night. It was that bad! I thought I will send the product back, but started to read reviews. Found one saying that you should give this chew after the meal. Next time I gave my dog Kong stuffed with his regular food, and then half of the chew, and then more food in Kong. 15 min went ok, and he did not have to run outside. Later same day I did it again - food-chew-food, and he was fine. And I have to mention that he is a big boy and never had problems with his stomach before. And he eats different things.<br />Two things I can summarize - watch your dog during and after you give the chew, and give some food either before or right after the chew is gone.",Neutral
"Ok, so I got these cause they were cheap. First time I ordered they were great! They tasted like all other dried goji berries I had tasted. Second time, they tasted a little bit musty. It is like they have been stored in plastic for a while, and now they taste artificial. They also have a very suspicious bright red color to them. Am I getting what I paid for?",Neutral
"I read about these for weight loss among other benefits and thought I'd try them.  Make sure you know they are related to the tomato and chili pepper more than a normal ""berry"" because they taste more like a bit of dried tomato than a sweet fruit.

"I bought this looking for a healthier alternative for chocolate milk.  Unfortunately the kids don't like it at all, and I have to admit, I didn't really care for it either.  I had a hard time getting it mixed in, so it tasted grainy.  I tried mixing it in the blender for smoothies and the blender couldn't even get it mixed in.  I've been able to sneak it into pancake mix and oatmeal, just to use it up, but I won't be buying it again.  I give it 3 stars for nutritional value.",Neutral

"The Coconut Palm Sugar wasn't too bad as a substitute for baking, however, it is significantly less sweet then  white sugar. I enjoyed that it wasn't as sweet but for those that want a sweet pastry, you may need to readjust the amount when using the coconut palm sugar. Also, it is hard to make a syrup out of it and melts quite a bit faster than white sugar.",Neutral
"I love this tea, its everything everybody is saying about it. But from the first time I brewed this tea, my husband took one look and said to me that its not hibiscus but sorrel tea. I argued, whatever but I decided to look it up anyways  because the tea did look and taste like sorrel drink that we make in the Caribbean.  In the US its called red hibiscus or roselle or Florida cranberry. It does lower blood pressure and it is healthy. My point is that folks think they are drinking actual flower tea and it is misleading when  advertisers have these pretty hibiscus flowers on the cans etc (not this particular brand). This plant is comercially grown in the tropics and also in the US in Louisiana and Florida.",Neutral
"I can't have caffeine, so I was anxious to try this hibiscus tea from Davidson's.  I read some of the other reviews before I made the purchase, and most of them were good, so I decided to try it.<br /><br />The other reviews mentioned that this tea was tart and fruity.  I found it very tart, but not overly fruity.  Perhaps this tea has lost some of its flavor since the bag didn't seem very air tight.<br /><br />Other reviews also mention a floral smell when brewing the tea, to me it smelled a little like compost, which was slightly off-putting.  The dry tea didn't have much of a smell either- it did smell barely of dried flowers.<br /><br />The color is nice- a deep and clear red, and the flavor is ok- but I found the sourness is more appealing to me as an iced tea drink.<br /><br />I also like to put skim milk in my tea, and I don't recommend doing that, since the acidity/sourness of the tea caused it to curdle.<br /><br />The printing on the bag seemed faded, and the other reviews mention difference in bags that the tea comes in.  This particular shipment was in the fold down bag, not the zip-lock bag, like some of their other teas.  This makes me think that they are either gradually changing over to the new bags, and I got an old bag of tea- or they are inconsistent with rotating their product.<br /><br />I look forward to trying a couple more hibiscus teas that are out there so I know more about the way that it is supposed to taste.",Neutral

"I'm a big fan of Sumatra beans and Starbucks compares favorably with the locally available Peet's. The problem with all the Starbucks ground coffee I've seen is that there's no indicator on the package or in the product description as to the fineness of the grind. In fact, it's a medium grind like the generic canned supermarket brands, suitable for drip and percolator type coffee makers. In my local supermarket, Starbucks is available and some varieties are whole beans, but not Sumatra.<br /><br />I use an espresso machine and had to re-grind the Starbucks to make a decent brew. I won't be purchasing ground Starbucks again.",Neutral

In fact, I'm beginning to wonder if they're factory ""rejects"".  So, if you can deal with the fact that you may get a bunch of powder from the tablets before one even comes out of the dispenser, than this product should be OK for you.

"These cookies are much healthier than other large, soft, packaged cookies. Unfortunately, they taste like it. They are relatively low in sugar and fat, which is good, and they actually have a very nice flavor. The only problem is that they are dry and ""airy"" and fall apart. I thought about dipping them in milk, but with the texture, they'd fall apart into nothing. I've been looking for a good breakfast cookie that is healthy and my kids will eat. This is not it.",Neutral
"Disappointed in these on flavor or make that lack of flavor.  They taste like a cereal bar to me.  Nice and soft, just not much taste.  I think you would be better off with the lower cost oatmeal cookies at the bakery.  The only advantage to these is the convenience of individual wrapping, but that is what plastic baggies are for.  Sorry, these strike out as being tasty.  There are better cookies at your store bakery department.",Neutral
"Each box contains 6 individually packaged (""Packs To Go"") cookies.<br /><br />The cookies list out at 1.48 oz each and 180 calories.<br /><br />The cookies are anywhere from 3 to 3.25 inches in diameter, and uniformly about a half inch thick.<br /><br />They do come out of the wrapper pretty soft and when you break the cookie in half it splits pretty well and doesn't crumble too much.<br /><br />I noticed a great deal more almond pieces in my cookies than chocolate ""chunks"", but I also noticed some of the chocolate had melted int he wrapper and was maybe left inside.<br /><br />The texture is good, but once you start chew the cookie just kind of come apart in your mouth, but in my experience that is how most ""Soft Baked"" cookies are.  Plus, these are oatmeal cookie so the texture is much looser, you do definitely see and taste the oats which is nice.<br /><br />The flavor is okay, the chocolate is nothing special, I would say the almonds are of good quality and flavor.  The cookie itself is sweet, but not too, with an okay butter and vanilla flavor to them.  Which is surprising since there is no butter in the ingredients, I can only guess the flavor was added.<br /><br />Overall a decent cookie, nothing special, but they are soft, and come individually wrapped so you don't have to worry about them drying out.  I think without much effort you could make something just as good at home, but if you are looking for something to throw in the lunchbox that provides some fiber (4g) and some nuts (3g protein) you wouldn't be too far off going with these.<br /><br />If you have a question feel free to leave a comment and I will do my best to answer.",Neutral
"These look good, and while they are soft, they were not very flavorful.  My wife who really loves chocolate, gave these a B-, and would not buy them again.  Each cookie is sealed in a separate package, the package was easy to open, and each cookie is about 3 1/4 inches in diameter  -- a good size for a cookie, but huge, but not too small.

"I love cookies. And anyone who loves cookies knows that homemade is always best.  Store bought will always taste...store bought--just a little too much like chemicals and flour and a little less like...fresh.<br /><br />Comparing these with, say, Chips Ahoy--you get a big cookie, rather soft, and a generous portion, that tastes a bit softer. Compare to the ultra decadent Pepperidge Farm big cookies? this is just bland by itself. With coffee, the flavors perked considerably.<br /><br />Me, if I need a big cookie for lunch packing, I'll spring for the Pepperidge Farm and get total indulgence. However moms and dads with kids might like the fact that each of these is individually wrapped and that Quaker is a good quality company.",Neutral
"The cookies are soft but very dry and tasted nothing like an oatmeal cookie. It reminded me more of a Keebler Soft n Chewy cookie, with a few almond bits tossed in.  If the bits of almonds and chocolate were bigger I think my kids would of liked these cookies. They all passed on having a second cookie. These won't be making it into the lunchboxes this year.",Neutral
"I had high expectations for these cookies but they weren't quite as good as I anticipated.<br /><br />They are very chewy and fresh-tasting -- that's the good news. But they're not exactly bursting with flavor and, as moist as they seem to the touch, they tasted dry as I ate them. My wife said the same, unprompted. I tried them with black coffee and they're just a bit gluey as you munch.<br /><br />If you want chocolate, this would not be a great choice. If you want something more akin to the mild taste of a scone, these individually-wrapped cookies would be okay if you don't mind the dryness.",Neutral
"Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookies are indeed soft. Individual wrapping of each cookie ensures that they stay soft and fresh until your are ready to eat them. Unfortunately, they are very bland tasting, which is a surprise for Quaker products. I wouldn't buy them if you expect a flavorful cookie. So you trade soft and fresh for flavorful. So if you are looking for cookies that excite your taste buds, I'm afraid you will have to look elsewhere.",Neutral
"the cookie is moist and chewy and has a great deal of sweetness from the combination of almonds and oats. if it had a little more chocolate it would be an excellent cookie. i couldn't help it, but every time i had one, i was chewing for the chocolate after the first few bites. and there wasn't enough there to keep me interested. but, i wouldn't put them out of my lunchbox by any means.",Neutral
"Pros:<br />-Made with whole grains (10 g per serving)<br />-4 g fiber per serving<br />-Pleasant oatmeal taste<br />-Almond bits provide nice crunch<br />-Relatively low in sugar for a cookie<br />-Individually wrapped cookies:  keeps each cookie fresh after box is opened and makes for easy transport in lunchboxes, handbags, wherever<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Powdery and dry texture<br />-Not much chocolate or almond flavor<br />-Pricier than most other cookies",Neutral
"This is a pretty substantial cookie with a decent amount of fiber conveniently packaged for work or school. At 180 calories per cookie (1 per pack) it's not a diet food in my opinion, and it's not a gourmet treat (nothing like, say, a Pepperdige Farm cookie in the taste department). It is a dry, soft cookie with pleasant chocolate and almond flavor. Decent choice for a school lunch or on-th-go snack, but unlikely to satisfy a cookie lover wanting a treat.",Neutral
"I'm really on the fence on this product.  On the one hand, I certainly appreciate the effort that went into making a truly healthy cookie.  Each cookie contains only 9 grams of sugar, zero Trans Fats and 16% of the recommended daily fiber intake.  This is a truly great cookie from a health standpoint.<br /><br />However, 9 grams of sugar doesn't have much taste or sweetness.  I didn't know if I was eating a cookie or a bowl of dry oats.  Now dry outs may be very good for you, but they're not terribly tasty, and the flavor of Quaker's Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies was, on the whole, rather a disappointment.  It tasted nothing like what I expect an oatmeal cookie to taste like, and I don't mean that in a complimentary way.  And these were chocolate chip almond oatmeal cookies?  I really couldn't taste the chocolate chips or the almonds.<br /><br />The box contained six cookies, individually wrapped.  But the size of each cookie was not terribly impressive, especially considering that there are only six cookies to a box.<br /><br />In the end, I will give it five stars for wholesomeness, but detract two for flavor.  And when it comes to oatmeal cookies, I like flavor.",Neutral
"These cookies are tasty, but 180 calories per cookie?  Quaker may think that they are nutritious because they contain oats and fiber, but what about the calorie count which is way too high for just one cookie.  I will not buy this product again.",Neutral
"I was looking forward to trying these, but they did not live up to my expectations. Not enough chocolate chunks, almost enough almonds. The manufactured taste is not something I crave. I had never thought to put almonds into cookies, as opposed to walnuts which I don't like. This give me a great idea to make homemade chocolate chip cookies with almonds! I love soft baked cookies, these hit the spot in that department, but failed in flavor.",Neutral
"I really liked how they were individually wrapped.  Bummer that a box only has 6 cookies in it, doesn't feel like much value.  The cookies didn't have a whole lot of chocolate in them, so a little disappointed in that.  They were soft which I like, yet still seemed to be a little dry and crumbly, which I did not like.  4 grams of fiber is nice, and 9 grams of sugar is nice and low for a sweet treat (our household limit per serving of something sweetened is 9 grams sugar), but at 180 calories per cookie, you won't see our family eating too many of these.",Neutral
"So far four of the people in my family who have tried these cookies have not liked them enough for me to buy them.  I'm really glad I got to try a sample before I was tempted in the grocery store because Quaker is one of my favorite brand names.<br /><br />The fact that they are portion controlled in a single-cookie-pouch is a plus if you want to make it harder on yourself to *accidentally* overeat sweet cookies.  Each cookie is 180 calories.<br /><br />If you want to have something to pack in a lunch box or stash in a drawer at the office, these will remain fresh for quite a while.  My box has an October 25, 2012 best-used-by date -- about three months at least.<br /><br />Of the six packets in the box, four cookies were whole and two were broken.  The cookie is soft but very dry which was interesting because the chocolate chunks melt on contact with your fingers.  The chocolate was soft, the almond pieces were firm, and the whole oat grains were slightly tough.  My first impression was dry with a sawdust-like texture.<br /><br />Overall, I would suggest having this treat with something liquid - coffee, hot tea, milk.  It actually does look like a fresh home baked cookie so it is attractive to the eye.  The chocolate chunks and almond pieces were large enough to be easily identifiable and the cookie was not overly sweet, just enough to satisfy a craving for something to treat yourself with.  This product will not be a favorite with my family, but I can certainly see where they would be convenient for specific reasons and at specific times.",Neutral
"Overall, I liked the cookies for their flavor, pleasant aroma and texture.  However, while somewhat moist and pleasantly chewy, they did taste a little dry. I had a few with my usual coffee, and they paired quite well.  I also had a few with milk, and that didn't turn out well.<br /><br />The cookies actually reminded me of a few of the high-fiber energy bars on the market.  The cookies themselves were heavy on the oats and quite generous with the chocolate (but not the almonds).  Each cookie was quite substantial and just two of them with milk could be a satisfying meal.<br /><br />The cookies were soft and chewy, but not at all gooey, like eating a jelly bean or peanut butter.  The oat content had good consistency and the total cookie was pleasing to nibble on.<br /><br />Would I buy the product if given the chance?  Probably not, as it is not a good dippin' cookie.  I tried pairing it with milk, and it did not dip well (it fell apart when wetted), though it did taste good with milk.  Still, the fiber content and heft alone have their merits, and in a pinch, I would definitely take a few bites.",Neutral
"i like soft baked cookies as a quick fix with coffee in the morning when there's no baked goods around the house.  these cookies are individually wrapped, good for lunch boxes but the actual cookie is on the light side not as solid as the soft baked ones by Pepperridge Farms.  when i eat one of the Pepperridge cookies i feel satisfied but these Quaker Oats ones leave me still hungry.",Neutral
"I was very excited to tear into this box of cookies when it arrived today, and I am sorry to say I'm left a little let down. The cookies are soft, but they are also rather dry and crumbly. I'd place it in between a Grandma's brand cookie (nice and tender) and a pecan sandie/chips ahoy type cookie (deliberately, delightfully crispy). I really couldn't taste much almond or chocolate, either, which was sad.<br /><br />So while they're not gross, I could definitely make a similar cookie at home and it would be *much* more tasty and tender - not to mention with far fewer ingredients in.",Neutral
"I have to admit I was a bit disappointed in this cookie--the marketing promises whole grain Quaker Oats, plenty of fiber, and ""natural"" chocolate and almond flavor. Plus it comes from the good folks at Quaker Oats. And yes, whole grain oat flour is listed first among the ingredients, and yes, each cookie contains 4 grams of dietary fiber (16% of the RDA). The taste, however (and let's be honest, here--why else does one eat a cookie?), leaves much to be desired. It's superior to run-of-the-mill hard-baked chocolate chip cookies, but that's not really saying much. As soft-baked cookies go, this one is just mediocre. The chocolate flavor is not especially rich, the almond flavor is so subtle that it's almost undetectable, and the cookie's overall texture and flavor are decidedly bland. If I'm going to eat 180 calories worth of cookie, I'm going to opt for a much tastier indulgence than this.",Neutral
"These cookies are OK.  They are individually wrapped in sealed pouches so I expected them to be moist like many of the competitive products.  I found them a little dry but still soft.<br /><br />The flavor was fine.  They weren't too sweet which is kinda what you get with oatmeal cookies.  I thought the chocolate and almonds would make them sweeter but they were not.  You can taste the oatmeal which is nice as some other oatmeal cookies you can only taste the added ingredients.<br /><br />Overall, a milder cookie that was a little dry, but not too dry, still soft, good oatmeal flavor, sweet but not too sweet.<br /><br />If that is what you are craving then give these a try.",Neutral
"I am a big fan of home made cookies, particularly chocolate and oatmeal cookies. I also will eat an occasional Chips Ahoy cookie. The Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Almond is okay but I would likely never buy them. The taste is not as good as the homemade or Chips Ahoy and I not fond of the texture as well. They are a bit bland and not that soft. They are also filled with the usual large list of chemicals found in most commercial products of this type. I realize they must be preserved to last for months and must retain their softer texture through artificial means. I will likely finish the box I have, but cannot really recommend them.",Neutral
"I like oatmeal cookies but I prefer them to be more substantial than these.  That is, I prefer the type that are crunchy/chewy that don't crumble as one takes a bite.<br /><br />These were too dry for the moist cake-type oatmeal cookies so they really do not fit into either category and the texture was odd.  The flavor was marginal, mostly just sweet with none of the toasty flavor I associate with oatmeal cookies.<br /><br />I also do not like the long list of preservatives and unpronounceable ingredients.",Neutral
"Oatmeal cookies can be found in pretty much any store, in a variety of brands. So, in order to get my attention it has to be something pretty special. This, is just average, but at a premium price.<br /><br />For starters make sure to pay attention to the box. There are only 6 cookies in a rather large box. Now, flip the box around and look at the ingredients. When I hear oatmeal and almond cookie I expect something at least mildly healthy. To put it frankly the nutrition value of these cookies is lacking.<br /><br />The taste is ok. Nothing really special about it. It didn't seem overly flavorful, but I can't say I disliked them either. The best thing I can say is, it's a good indication of quality if I would get them again. Sadly, I don't see this being my first or second choice when I am looking to buy some cookies. Not even in my top ten if I was being 100% honest.",Neutral

Recently due to a back order situation on Jet Fuel I ordered Tully's Italian Roast to hold me over until Jet Fuel arrived.  Much to my chagrin I found the 24 count package of Italian Roast produces a much weaker flavor than the one I received in the Sampler Package.  I could still get a bold cup but only using the medium setting on my Keurig.  If you like a bold coffee and have family members who prefer medium roast I'd suggest the sampler rather than 2x24 count Italian Roast.

"Good quality canned albacore tuna has very little fishy taste or smell.  Sadly, Chicken of the Sea is not a good quality albacore tuna.<br /><br />These days, I buy albacore because ""regular"" canned tuna smells so strong,it makes me want to gag. (Think cheap cat food.)  It tastes too fishy, and is filled with less than desirable pieces. (Skin, etc.) Albacore contains ""cleaner"" meat chunks and I rarely ever see any bad bits in the can. It's paler in color and has a much more desirable flavor.<br /><br />Growing up, my Mom always bought ""regular"" tuna, (as opposed to albacore) and I never remember it smelling as strong as ""regular"" tuna does now. I've tried many different brands, and I've finally realized that I have to move to the pricier albacore for a better ""tuna"" experience.<br /><br />This Chicken of the Sea Albacore is very watery, (more to drain off) and the consistency in the can is ""loose.""

However, I was disappointed in my uses of this product, in that it was not as concentrated as I expected it to be, and therefore had to be used in larger quantities that I wanted to use.  Yes, its taste is better than a traditional canned tomato paste, but again I was finding that I had to often use more of this to get the flavor impact I wanted - and at this price, I don't think you should have to use a quarter to a third of a tube each time you put this product to use.<br /><br />I'm going to next get some oil based sun dried tomatoes, and use them to create my own concentrated paste - I may also be disappointed with the result of that experiment, but something tells me it will prove to be a success.",Neutral

"I thought that I would give this a try as a way to keep my 2 Year old English Mastiff's teeth in good condition. I treat my dogs (the other is a rescue hound) homepathically (no chemical vaccinations, etc) and this I thought, would fall in line with not having to give him anesthesia for routine teeth cleaning.<br /><br />I found others who mentioned choking incidents to be right. My Mastiff can plow through a huge rawhide bone in no time and with this chip, he literally just sucked it in and kept regurgitating it to soften it. Not good...too scary for me. The large size is even too small for a Mastiff's huge mouth and I will not buy these again. I will just continue with teeth brushing--wlthough I hate doing it more than I think they do :-)<br /><br />I don't feel right giving it a 3 star rating, for me, I really need a not applicable rating.

"These chews did indeed prove good for my dogs' teeth - one of them had severe tarter issues, and its much better now though to be fair, I used a lot of other products (like Greenies, enzymatic toothpaste etc) along with this. This does possess a choking hazard for dogs like labradors who are tempted to swallow food rather than patiently chew them, and must be given these chews only when monitored (as is the case with other chews like bully sticks).<br />But one major issue that I encountered with these chews is that they give a bad gas to my dogs - enough to drive the humans out of the house.

Product appears to work as advertized and my dog spends roughly 25 minutes chewing them. One major gripe is the inconsistently of the size of the large chews. There is just no excuse for some of these being less than half the size of others in the same bag. I paid for a bag of large chews and I expect large chews. Apparently no quality control exists or it doesn't matter to the company what size chew goes in what size bag.,Neutral

But they are definitely the culprit. She might be the exception and maybe she just has a sensitive stomach, but I recommend you ask for a few samples at your vet to make sure your dog's stomach agrees with them before you buy the big bag.  Side note, our 5 month old Goldendoodle doesn't even like them, won't touch them, and he's a chewer!  I guess every dog is different.",Neutral
"This is the sort of thing that is handy to keep on hand for quickly doctoring up a simple meal.  It's definitely not awesome pesto; think of it more as a condiment, like mustard or ketchup.  What I typically use it for, in that regard, is as a spread on sandwiches, when I'm tired of the usual versions.  It works well in particular on sandwiches featuring cheese or poultry.  It doesn't have much kick on its own as a sauce for pasta; but it can be added to things like frozen pasta dinners or canned soups etc. to give them a little more flavor.<br /><br />One thing I want to mention too is that this product can ""spit"" and spatter when trying to squeeze it out.  When you are ready to open a tube, be sure you pierce the opening fully, so that any chunks within won't get stuck; and keep the bottom of the tube squeezed and rolled up to compact the remainder in the tube as best you can.",Neutral

I particularly like medium roasts and I don't care for a coffee with a lot of acidity and a bitter aftertaste, so this one fits the bill.<br /><br />The only downside to this k cup is that the aroma.  It wasn't the most appetizing after the first cup was brewed, but it made up for that in taste.  This isn't a point that really bothers me, but I could see it being a downside for some people.<br /><br />When I brew this blend on my way out the door, I often throw in some french vanilla creamer and it's my perfect morning caffeine kick.<br /><br />So far this is the best average blend we've tried.  We're open to others but until we find something better, we're sticking with the Caribou Blend.",Neutral

"If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it).

I think I'll stick to Salada green tea and keep my black tea Earl Grey. Salada doesn't have that hay like taste or the bitter aftertaste that some green teas have and it's inexpensive.

Usually I get grossed out by the amount of sinew in packaged jerky but I have not found much in this brand yet.<br /><br />Updating after opening all 4 bags that came in an order: 3 bags were good but the 4th bag was all gristle and fat. There was not one piece that was edible in it. So they definitely have a quality control problem. Pity, because the good pieces are quite good, though the teriyaki flavor is a bit chemical for me. Still better than most other jerky brands",Neutral

I'll try one more bag for the reasons I cite above, but if the next one is like the 1st two, I'm going to stop buying this product.

Every 2nd or 3rd piece from the bags I've been delivered turns into a gum ball that I'm not willing to swallow, but it is just so darn tasty.  Dunno how long I'll stay with this, but for now ...

"It's great-tasting jerky, but if you're trying to avoid sweets, you might want to steer clear of this.  A one-ounce serving has seven grams of sugar.  Seven grams is almost a quarter of an ounce.  So a quarter of this product's weight comes from sugar.  Not exactly what you'd expect from a dried beef snack, but not much different from several other brands.  In fact, most popular brands have 5 or more grams of sugar per ounce.  If you don't mind the sugar, go for it!",Neutral
"The Jerky had a nice, seasoned flavor to it, but I did not really enjoy the consistency and texture of it.  Rather than being chewy like other jerky I eat, it was much more crumbly.

Not sure that I would recommend it to another jerky aficionado, but I have 3 more bags to eat and the flavor of the meat is good.",Neutral
"Jim Davis may have been a Texas Rancher but the beef is sourced from ""USA or Uruguay or New Zealand or Australia and further processed in USA"" the flavor is overpowering, which I guess I should have expected from ""hickory"" but it doesn't taste like hickory smoke to me, it tastes like corn syrup (or maybe that's the hydrolyzed soy protein?) it's got enough hydrogenated this-and-that to fuel the Hindenburg. It's also loaded with sodium, which most jerky is, but it really *tastes* salty too. The meat is tender because it was tenderized with papain which is an enzyme in papayas (thanks Wikipedia) there does seem to be a good amount of gristly threads running through it. That doesn't really bother me so much, but it's definitely not ""naturally tender"" meat. This stuff is marginally edible but I wouldn't buy it again.

We use it for making espresso in a Saeco Odea Giro, which brews consistently high-quality espresso from the Supercrema beans. However, some of the espressos from this decaf were excellent while other brews had a bit of a weird taste. Whether it's due to the visible inhomogeneity of the beans, I cannot tell.

Being this coffee is at the highest roast temp, I assumed it would be very smokey, but I find that the Diedrich French Roast is more smokey and more smooth.  The beans did not seem as dark as I expected them to be.  They look more of a typical dark roast, below a French or Italian roast.  Who knows, maybe I'll like Kick Ass better.  And BTW, Diedrich is much cheaper ($9 for 12 oz).",Neutral

"Let me start by saying I really like these snacks. I've not tried the salt or cocoa flavors, but the pepper and salt taste very good. Very nutty with just the right amount of black pepper bite. These snacks are derived mostly from wheat and sunflower seeds with some sesame seeds. In addition to the black pepper flavor there is a slight hint of jalapeno and even less of garlic. While these are a great alternative to peanuts, they are not a low fat or low caloric snack. Each piece, or cracker, is about 10 calories and a serving has 10% of your RDA of sodium. Indeed, they taste very salty and suspiciously are difficult to stop eating.<br /><br />If I like Somersaults so much, why just 3 stars? If you look at the ingredients it seems odd that a high sodium snack has salt as its last ingredient. In fact, modified food starch comes before salt. Where is the rest of the sodium coming from? Look closely at the ""seasonings."" In parentheses the seasonings used in the snack are listed in order of abundance. The very first ""seasoning"" is ""spices"" and the second seasoning is ""yeast extract."" Yeast extract is an analog for MSG (processed free glutamic acid). In short, the sodium is mostly coming from a form of MSG. Please be careful eating these if you are sensitive to MSG.<br /><br />So what do we have here? A tasty snack that contains too much sodium and has a flavor enhancer derived from a form of MSG. I still really really like these snacks and I will continue to buy them, but with so much sodium and the use of yeast extract I can't rate these any higher. Note that this company is not by any means alone is labeling something as ""all natural"" while using a form of MSG.",Neutral

The box includes lots of noodles for two people, but the sauce is not as generous for the amount of noodles, and it's not very interesting.  You also have to add lots of other ingredients to make it resemble real Pad Thai, so it's not much of a time saver.  Still lots of work along with a disappointing taste.",Neutral
"Just to be clear, this is a starter kit. So you're going to have to add things like an egg, oil, meat, scallions, etc. But it is indeed a pretty good starter kit. I made this with some diced up chicken breast. It was so good that I ate the whole thing. I guess I was hungry. At first, I didn't think it had quite enough flavor, but then I just couldn't stop eating it. So I guess I liked it. I want a bit more flavor though. So next time I might try it with Kung Pao sauce, or something similar. I noticed that you can also buy the noodles by themselves, so you're free to try different recipes.<br /><br />Preparation was easy. You have to put the noodles in hot water to soak for about 25-30 minutes. Then you just take that time to prep the other ingredients and start the cooking process. By the time you get all that done, the noodles are ready to be added to the mix for the final stir-fry process. It smells great while it's cooking so that really gets the appetite worked up. Just remember to use a really big pan or a Wok. By the time you add the noodles, there's a lot of stuff there and it will over-fill a standard large frying pan.",Neutral
"I am an avid eater of Thai Food, so I was curious to see how this Pad Thai in a box would taste. Considering the price, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Ease of cooking: 3 stars. It's a tough trick to gauge when the noodles have been soaked long enough to get the perfect firmness. Also, you have to use and wash multiple pots to make this. One pot to boil the water for the noodles. And a frying pan to stir fry the noodles in.<br /><br />Taste: It's in a box. How much can you expect? Albeit, taste might have been better if I added some fresh bean sprouts, basil leaves, and shrimp or chicken.<br /><br />Price: Not bad considering it's a third of what  you would pay for compared to take out.<br /><br />All in all, I give it 3 stars.

Not too great for a supposedly ""healthy"" cereal bar.<br /><br />Long story short, they are great if you are trying to avoid that 300 calorie muffin or a super sugary dessert.

The wontons aren't abundant and they're tiny, so how much could it really cost to fill them and satisfy their customers?",Neutral
"I have been eating chocolate covered jells since the 50's. The only producer was Joyva. When I bite into a ring or ""nugget"" I want to go back to my very early years. That said, these are not Joyva, they taste good, but are not the ""original."" The quality was there, but both my wife and I thought they were more sweet than raspberry flavor.

"I love Pepperidge farm Soft Baked Oatmeal cookies. They make the perfect snack. While other cookies are hard and dry with the texture of sawdust these cookies taste great, and are soft like they've just come out of the oven.<br /><br />Downsides? Each cookie is 130 calories which is a lot for such a small cookie. Also these contain interesterified fats/oils which are chemically altered oils. Not really great for humans to consume.<br /><br />The result? I think I'll bake my own... Without the chemicals. It would probably be safer. 5 star taste. 2 star ingredients.

"While it was shipped to me insulated in styrofoam, no cold packs were included in the shipment--which was heading to Atlanta in early September (the American South in the summer).  I assumed that since I was paying over $20 for shipping--the absolute fastest time, greater care would be taken to ensure that the product arrived intact.  Unfortunately, the chocolates I received were largely melted.  I do not recommend the purchase of this item to be shipped to any region experiencing temperatures above 78 degrees.<br /><br />UPDATE: Received an e-mail, which read (in part) as follows: First, my apologies for not answering you earlier... I didn't notice there was a melting issue with your order till late last week while addressing a small more recent delivery problem.  Anyway, as you have noticed with your order, melting can and does happen in transit, but luckily only with an insignificant number of our packages as we only experience about two dozen or three dozen a year out of well over 15,000 packages. Insignificant when view in percentage terms, but still most infuriating when this happens.<br /><br />The e-mail went on to note that they are replacing my order.  I am stunned--I have had a melting issue before with a different chocolate company (remember, I live in Atlanta, Georgia, where summer temperatures are a bear), and I received nothing in the way of satisfaction.  I figured it would be the same and didn't even bother to directly contact the company (a mistake on my part).  I am *very* pleased with this level of service.",Neutral
"After sending these chocolates as Christmas presents in the last two years, I have decided to sample them myself.<br /><br />If one includes shipping, these chocolates costs around $1.50 per piece. That is not the highest chocolate price but still a premium price.<br /><br />As others have noted, the packaging is very well done. The box itself is wrapped in a stryofoam box. The ribbons add a nice touch to the presentation.<br /><br />The taste of these chocolates, however, is merely good. As a comparison, I think the Dove chocolates one can get at a grocery store is about 80% as good at about 1/5 the price.<br /><br />I think Godiva chocolates are about as good.<br /><br />But no one gets credit and thanks for sending Godiva (non-box kind) or Dove chocolates for Christmas and they certainly don't come in a nice box with a ribbon and a Belgian chocolate brand.<br /><br />I have tasted better chocolates.<br /><br />If you want the most premium tasting chocolates possible, then these will somewhat disappoint. Nonetheless, no one will dislike these chocolates especially when given as a Christmas present.",Neutral
"O,K. Leonidas is one of the best Belgian chocolate makers. Alas the ""pralines"" they make in Belgium are not for export (too much whipped cream and perishable ingredients). What they sell in America is the not so perishable stuff (hence the nuts and chocolate cream). That may be why so many reviewers evoke Nutella. I sent a box to my brother who spent time in Belgium as a teenager. He was very happy, but pointed out that there is more to Leonidas: white marzipan with a wanut on top, strawberry marzipan and, of course the pistacchio whipped cream, etc..Leonidas remains a good option if you like chocoalte.<br />Somehow my previous review was taken off.

"I ordered a Leonidas Belgian Chocolates: 1 lb General Assortment. I had to pick up the box at a local UPS outlet one day after the first attempted delivery.  The weather here is mild, not very hot or very cold.  When I opened the box and sampled the chocolates I immediately noticed a stale and unpalatable taste.  I recognized this taste from what occurs when chocolate is frozen or exposed to refrigerated air.  I responded to an email from Amazon asking for a review of my purchase.  I recounted my experience.  I received an email from Leonidas claiming that to their knowledge the product was not sent damaged.  Leonidas stated they would replace my order.  They have not.  I emailed Leonidas again asking about their intentions to replace my order.  I have received no reply.  Amazon attached a statement to the email I received from Leonidas disavowing any responsibility for Leonidas' product or the delivery of it.  So, here is my response: I will make no more purchases of food stuffs from Leonidas until a refund or replacement is forth coming.  I understand Amazon's position, but as a consumer of many items purchased via the Internet, I think that Amazon needs to review their policy regarding 3rd party vendors.  This is the first time any product I have purchase from Amazon had a problem.  I am somewhat shocked that their attitude towards my problem is: you're own your own.",Neutral

"These are great tasting tofu jerky strips!  Low in fat, high in protein, and pretty low in calories (99 calories in this flavor) across the board.  This flavor can be a bit spicy, depending on the batch.  My last batch was great, but the current one has some very small, but whole peppercorns throughout the jerky.  It's still good, but I'm on the fence as to which batch I prefer.  The only real complaint I have is that the packaging is absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to open without a pair of scissors.  It's not real great for on-the-go when you have to wrestle with the package with both hands and your teeth to get it open.  I can't understand why they made the packaging this way, what a bummer.",Neutral
"The first thing I noticed is that it smells JUST like the canned cat food I give my cat. This was a big turn-off, but I have had good experiences with wheat gluten in the past, so I gave it a shot.

They're marinating inside the package, and I understand that it probably needs to stay that way to keep the flavor, but it just doesn't feel like real beef jerky because it isn't dry. I've had thoughts about buying a dehydrator and laying these things inside for a few minutes. I've laid them out on napkins to dry them out, and that worked fine, but...bits of napkin get left behind and they aren't as tasty.<br /><br />I'm giving these 3 stars because they're good, and I do like them, but I really feel like they're just too moist to be considered jerky.",Neutral

Wheat gluten adds a jerky-like texture to vegetarian jerky, which is missing here.<br /><br />The strips are wet -- not moist -- but wet.

"I got the teriyaki flavor and, while the flavor is good and the texture is also good once you get it into your mouth, it can be a mess getting it there.  As other reviewers have noted, this is not like your typical dry jerky.  It seems more like something that would be created by the company that makes SlimJims or something - it's moist and chewy.  The individual packets don't tear easily, either, despite being notched at the end.  You know how sometimes plastic can tear very cleanly, but sometimes it turns into a ragged edge and becomes a struggle?  That's what happens with these 8 times out of 10.  So if you're out and about (not near a sink) and you try to open it and the tear doesn't work perfectly, you potentially have liquid dripping out onto you, certainly on your fingers as you're trying to get the jerky out of the package and into your mouth.  And the liquid dries sticky.<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, the flavor is good and I've now eaten most of mine, but I have taken to opening the package with scissors and eating them only at home so I can wash my hands afterward.",Neutral
"Not a good flavor overall. I have only tried the TERIYAKI flavored strips, and hate them. The texture and the sweetness is just gross together. I'm going to try a different flavor before writing this off, but yuck. I'm a vegan by the way, and I've had some amazingly delicious fake-feet products: this is not one of them.",Neutral
"Before I was vegetarian, there were few meat products that I even liked. Jerky was one of them, and I have had no luck finding a replacement.<br /><br />This is NOTHING like real jerky. It is very chewy in a SOFT way, and the flavoring was overpowering to the point that I ended up with a stomachache.<br /><br />It is OK.

"Once upon a time, Chebe made the best pizza crust ever - great texture, thin and chewy, very tasty, even rolled out easily without sticking to pan or rolling pin.  Friends not on the gluten-free diet raved about it too.<br /><br />Not any more.  The formula used for the mix seems to have changed along with the instructions - making it easier to put together (no more baking the crust first, as we used to do, before adding toppings), but resulting in an inferior product.  It's lost the chewy texture and the great taste and is now just another over-priced GF mix - one package makes one medium-sized pizza.<br /><br />If you make it, oil your pizza pan (something that never used to be necessary) before putting the dough in it, or the pizza will stick.  And don't pile the toppings too high or add too much sauce, or the dough won't bake through in the middle.  If you're lucky, you'll get a fairly edible pizza - but you could make a good bigger pizza for less just using the pizza dough recipe in a good GF cookbook - e.g., Elizabeth Barbone's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1891105418"">Easy Gluten-Free Baking</a>.

Palm oil would make these a little healthier, butter would make them taste much better, but alas manufacturers must always use the cheapest ingredients possible. Since Bahlsen's price is much more reasonable than other manufacturers, and since they are superior to most brands (except the crumbs!), they are worth considering.<br /><br />The reviewers who claim these have a hazelnut filling have sensitive palates.

I don't think its anywhere near as flavorful as the other version. There is a bit of heat to it, but its not a flavorful kind of heat. The other reviewers have talked about the sodium content and I was quite shocked. Both versions have the same serving size (1 tsp) and while the Huy Fong version has 100 mg per serving (4% of daily allowance) the Roland version has 2500 mg per serving (84% of daily allowance) so steer clear if you have high blood pressure. On another nutritional note, The Huy Fong version has 5 cal/tsp while the Roland version has 100 cal/tsp, so definitely not low calorie...<br /><br />Overall, if you had to choose between the two, I would definitely go for the original sriracha made by Huy Fong foods.

Preparation is fairly easy and quick. I can see these being useful on a short-term low-carb diet as a filler, but certainly not long-term. You'd get about the same thing if you bought a can of bamboo shoots used to make chop suey, and it would be a lot cheaper.",Neutral

"I don't think these are good or bad.  They are edible, not disgusting but not tasty either.  The texture is the worst thing about them.  It is not really like pasta.  No one in a blind tast test would guess that it is noodles.  There is a smell that is associated with opening the package but this was definitely exaggerated in some reviews.<br /><br />I Ate them and felt satisfied and full (I did not vomit or gag while attempting this).  This is obviously a huge plus as they have no calories.  I used Hungry girl's recipe for alfredo with these noodles.  I also added some canned asparagus for bulk.<br /><br />If you are looking for a zero calorie substitute that tastes just like real pasta, then you are going to be dissapointed.  If you are looking for something that is edible and will fill you up, you may want to consider it.<br /><br />My conclusion:  ehhh. I'll eat it, but it's nothing to write home about.",Neutral
"I had read earlier reviews about the noodles smelling like fish. This made me wary to buy them, but I decided to be adventurous and got them anyway. When I first cooked them, there was no fishy smell that I could detect. The only problem I found was the texture. It was like jello and rubber combined. Once I got used to the texture, they were ok, but did not absorb much of the sause they were cooked in.

The taste was masked by the tomato meat sauce that I used and both of them ate it eagerly. They are much more expensive than regular pasta.

"These take a bit of work; rise them off, then boil for a bit, then try to dry them off, then fry them till squeeky, then add them to your item you're making.  Good luck trying to cut them.  They have no taste so works well in stir fry, or soup, or even spagetti sauce.  I am used to dry noodles; these are slippery and wet when you take them out of the package.  I'm not impressed.",Neutral
"I ordered these noodles, (6) Packages, because I wanted pasta and was doing the hcg diet.  There is a slight odor of fish when you open the package.  I dumped the water out and rinsed the noodles(no big deal really), boiled them and then and put them in the pasta sauce.  The noodles don't really have a taste themselves but there is a strange consistency when you chew them.  Sort of like jelly fish--chewy.  My husband could not get past the consistency of the noodles.  I didn't mind it as much.  Like I said there is no taste to them really and I will eat the rest of them myself.  The packages are small probably meant to be individual servings.",Neutral
"I was not familiar with this product, but my wife was interested because of it's mention on popular daytime television.  Here are somethings you should know if you are unfamiliar with the product.<br /><br />1 star: The noodles come packaged in water, so one 7 oz package must be strained to obtain one 3 oz serving of noodles, very different from traditional dry pasta.<br />3 star: The package, noodles in water, is a bit awkward to store on your traditional pantry shelf, you can't really stack them, etc.<br />3 star: The noodles have an expiration date that is approximately four months away.  Don't order more than a few months supply.<br />3 star: Because the noodles are already hydrated, they do not really take on much flavor from cooking liquid, you better put them into a very flavorful dish.<br />2 star: Copared to pasta, these pre-hydrated noodles have a very slimy mouthfeel and they are not able to be cooked al dente, so they do not give the same fished result as a pasta substitute.<br />5 star: As advertised, they are low calorie, filling, and a great source of soluable fiber.",Neutral
"I wanted this to help me with constipation--again on what I heard on the Dr. Oz show.  I didn't see any help from eating them for that problem. I have bought some of the capsules, to see if I can get any success from them. Just received them today.",Neutral
THis product is ok.  If does have a foul odor that rinses off.  I'm italian so I really can't see putting marinara on these as some people have done.  In stir-frys and asian type dishes they are pretty good.  Great if you think about the zero calories!,Neutral
"So, we just got our shipment in today (super fast by the way).  Our first reaction was ""eww they're in liquid, and they look like white worms!""  So I came here to read the reviews. Something I should've done first I guess.  I had no idea they came in liquid--I assumed they came dry, as all pastas do. I also didn't know how small the packages are!  Now, I'm reading that they stink too?  Oh wow.  Do I even bother trying them? I bought them for 3 family members, one is on the HCG diet, and 2 are diabetics. To feed us I'll probably have to use my whole order--all 6 packages. Not sure if I'm happy with this...",Neutral
"I rate it 3 stars because of my personal taste.  I still think it's a good alternative for people who need it, but I won't reorder.  I've been using the shiritaki noodles that are Soy/tofu based and I like them a lot more.  These are a bit too strange for me. It's plant cellulose it seems.  The texture is of an acquired taste, a bit gelatinous, a bit like cartilage. They're transparent and could be used in an asian soup quite well.  I'm probably going to do this with the remaining bags I got.  It's a different way to eat soluble fibers, but it makes a strange noodle.  I really love the Tofu ones though, So if you can eat soy I'd got for those instead.",Neutral

"These noodles did not cure my cataracts, nor did they clear up my cousin Ned's mysterious rash he got while visiting the Philippines. I cooked two of the six packages up and tried to feed them to the gimp rooster and the mangy-lookin' goose, but they just rooted around looking for the dried peas like in the noodle cups. Next day, yep: rooster still walkin' cockeyed and goose still looking like a beat up dirty pillow at the dump. I'd say these ""miracle"" noodles are no different than snake oil and a gypsy fortune. Miracle angel hair...hmph...my left toe! But they taste alright with soy sauce!",Neutral
"I was prepared for an awful smell when opening the bag based on the reviews. The water smells like fish, not a big deal to me. I rinsed the noodles for 2 minutes in hot water, then placed in boiling water for another 2-3 minutes. I then mixed the noodles with the sauce only from a popular Spicy Szechuan Style Vegetable & Chicken weight loss frozen food (softened it in the microwave, then cut the sauce from the noodles packaged with it). I put the noodles with the sauce in the fridge for 22 hours before eating them based on the suggestion of other reviews.<br /><br />The texture is.....strange. There is no food product on the market that I can 100% compare it to. They are rubbery and somewhat hard to break down with your teeth when you chew them.<br /><br />Marinating the noodles did not help, they were still flavorless, but it didn't matter very much because the sauce itself was spicy enough to mask the fact that the noodles had no flavor.<br /><br />I'd suggest the noodles to anyone trying to lose weight or cut down on carbs. They are not something I would want to eat otherwise.",Neutral
"It's not entirely obvious from the photos here on Amazon but these 7 ounce packages aren't like normal pasta, they're basically ""precooked"" noodles that are in bags filled with water so the actual quantity of noodles is maybe a small scoop per pricey bag. The noodles themselves have a texture that's (naturally) better suited to asian style noodle dishes (i.e. a ramen bowl) and upon initially opening the package there is definitely a vaguely fish-like scent-it's not a horrible pungent scent but more reminiscent of noodles just cooked in fish soup (really hard to describe to be honest). Thankfully this does go away nicely after rinsing and blanching per the instructions, and even when eaten with just red pasta sauce there weren't any weird flavors but the textures just didn't really feel at home here.<br />Honestly these noodles would feel most at home in making a low carb ramen noodle bowl or something similar, but the real reason I'm not going to buy these again is simply that the price is insane for the quantity you get.",Neutral
"I'm really confused by the reviewers claiming they couldn't wash the smell off.  When first opened the bag smells EXACTLY like old edamame.  The fact that it smells like something that is also food helped me get past it a little. I put the noodles in a colander and ran hot water over them for less than a minute while tossing them around with my hands.  That removed the smell completely.  I think the assertion that they taste ""rubbery"" is a little strong.  There certainly chewy, but in the same way that bean sprouts or limp celery is chewy.  It's basically true that they take on the taste of your sauce, though, having prepared them in beef broth with hot sauce, it didn't really seem like they were absorbing the flavor so much as they were just coated in it.<br /><br />The only real criticism I have is that you really don't get all that much volume for your money.  A whole package makes slightly more than a brick of Top-Ramen soup--at 2.50 a package the calorie savings are really the only thing it has going for it.  For the same price, I could eat a whole ton of carrots or green beans, which I find way more satisfying and would be only a trifle more caloric.  I guess I figured shiritaki noodles would be better than carrots at answering my carb craving, but they're really not.  So ultimately, I liked the product, but I probably wouldn't buy again for price reasons.<br /><br />Also, and I'm not sure how this should influence buying decisions overall, but one of the bags popped and leaked its smelly juice all over the box in shipping.  To make matters worse, the noodles were part of an order that contained some electronics that were (thankfully) shrink wrapped.  Still, unpacking everything from a pool of shiritaki juice was nightmare.",Neutral
"This is the second type of Miracle Noodle I have tried. I like the texture of this smaller noodle better then the Fettuccine size. I used it under a buffalo,vegetable & crushed tomato spaghetti sauce. A very low carbohydrate meal with a nice feeling in the tummy.<br />It does not have any taste of it's own so don't mistake it for real pasta. What it does is add texture and fullness to a meal without calories or carbs. I may eat this about once a week. It's a nice change.",Neutral
"It's not too widely mentioned that this product is packed in water that has to be rinsed away. So at over $2 a mugful, this is a very pricey noodle. But dieting is about dealing with denial for a longer term reward, and this product makes dieting feel like less of a sacrifice.<br /><br />Once prepared PROPERLY (follow the package instructions folks) and introduced into a tasty stir fry, it becomes (to my palate) almost indistinguishable from a 200 calorie serving of rice noodles.  I find it has a nice slightly chewy texture.  It's not alien or gummy as some have implied here.<br /><br />I don't think I would use this in Italian dishes, it's more reminiscent of glass noodles. I'm very happy for this pricey little miracle.<br /><br />UPDATE - I'm downgrading this to 3 stars.  A good product but I have since discovered kelp noodles and like them better. Kelp noodles are a much better value, and aren't packed in a briney liquid, and they are easier to prepare.",Neutral
"Fishy smell yes, weird texture yes. The smell really gets to me I have to hold my breath while im rinsing them. Then I boil them.

Very diet life saving.",Neutral
These noodles smell bad when you open the bag! You've been warned. But it goes away when you mix the noodles in with sauces and spices. Its a nice addition to a stir fry.,Neutral
I like to make a quick salad using these tiny canned shrimps but the cans of shrimp I got were overcooked and tough.  I have bought this product many times before at my local grocery store but this was the first time that the shrimps were actually tough and hard like they had been cooked for too long.  Normally I would recommend these tiny canned shrimps but if Crown Prince has changed it's preparation for some reason......I can not say that I would recommend these any longer.,Neutral

"These pouches of ""Mediterranean Style"" Chuck Salmon are handy to have around the house for a quick snack with no prep time,or to take along for meals on the go. I like to keep things like this, or cans of kippered herring, along with rice cakes or WASA bread in my glove box because I do not eat fast food. The taste is good, with a bit of spiciness. I was a little disappointed that there were no Italian herbs like oregano or basil. Once I get my garden in, I'll just bring some along with me. But really, it would have helped the flavor and nutrician quite a bit if they had included some herbs. Also, the soybean oil taste is not great; olive oil would have been much better. My other suggestion would be less water. The net weight is 3.5 ounces, but because of the water content, there isn't as much actual salmon as I had anticipated. An OK product, though.",Neutral
"I've edited this review -- used to be five stars, now it's three.  Native Forest Organic was top-quality stuff last year.  It was as good as Natural Value Organic (you can see my review here <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTKRLU"">Natural Value Organic Coconut Milk Lite, 14 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>), which is now more expensive than this Native Forest.  However, I just got two cases and it is no longer half liquid, half solid as it should be.  Now, it is thin, almost homogenized, along the lines of something like ""light"" coconut milk.  It is still fresh and good-tasting, but just does not go as far.",Neutral
"This is a fantastic product. Delicious and exactly what I need.<br /><br />However, the case of 12 arrived with every single can dented.

"I have cancelled my ongoing delivery of this coconut milk because all the cans in the last two shipments have had congealed coconut at the top with a little liquid remaining underneath.

"the milk is pretty good, and it does say product of thailand on the can, but like other reviewers, i also received several dented cans. i know there's not really anything wrong with dented cans, and i have shopped at several discount grocery stores (aldi, UGO - united grocery outlet, bottom dollar, etc) so i've eaten plenty of canned goods from dented cans, but i was shopping at a grocery outlet, so i expected to see dented cans at a greatly reduced price. amazon is not a grocery outlet and i shouldn't have to pay ""full price"" for dented cans. i asked my boyfriend, ""how should i feel about this?"" and he said, ""pissed."" i'm not angry, but as i said, i expect quality assurance from amazon. also, this has nothing to do with the product, but how is amazon gonna offer the super saver shipping (for orders over $25) on this item, then price it at $23.76 (twenty-three dollars and seventy-six cents}? you have to either pay the shipping on a 12lb item or purchase another item in order to get the free shipping. that's pretty lame customer care, amazon. don't be so shady, we're not stupid.",Neutral
"This is a great product at a very good price. Delivery time was good, but a quarter of the cans had large dents in them, another quarter had small dents and only half of the cans (6) had no dents at all. So far, the dented cans I opened did not seem to suffer any quality loss, but I would feel a lot better if all the cans were dent-free. According to USDA Food Safety guidelines, there is always a danger that deep dents may have sharp points which allow bacteria to enter the can, and hence contaminating the food in the can.<br /><br />I would give a 5 star rating if all the cans were dent-free.",Neutral
"Being relatively new to the coconut milk scene, I started at my local grocery store with the only coconut milk I found there -- Thai Kitchen.  It was delicious--so rich and creamy.  I was hooked!  Imagine my surprise when I opened my first can of Native Forest Organic Coconut Milk.  It was thin and watery, not thick and creamy like the Thai Kitchen.<br /><br />I read the Amazon reviews and learned that coconut milk from Sri Lanka is thin and watery, while that which comes from Thailand is thick and creamy.  I checked the can.  Yup.  Sri Lanka.  The reviews are correct.<br /><br />The main reason I bought coconut milk from Amazon was that the price was a little cheaper buying it in bulk.  But I would rather have the better coconut milk and pay 25 to 30 cents more a can.  I probably won't buy coconut milk from Amazon anymore, since the customer is not able to select the country of origin for the product.",Neutral
"I've been receiving this through Subscribe & save for nine months, and the quality of my last two cases has decreased....the change in the last batch was minor, but this batch is really sad.<br /><br />The original product was high-quality with a thick layer of coconut ""cream"" on top in temperatures over 74 degrees and a pudding-like consistency after mixing when stored in the refrigerator.  This last batch is watery from the can, liquid from the fridge, and oddly sweet for ""unsweetened"" coconut milk.<br /><br />I'm aware that the price for coconut oil and flesh has risen dramatically or late, and I can only guess that this decline in quality is Native Forest's attempt to continue providing organic coconut milk at a reasonable price.  There is no set ratio for how much coconut flesh is in a can of coconut milk, which is pureed coconut flesh blended with water.  Higher quality brands typically provide a higher ratio of flesh to water, low quality brands are sometimes made only with ""coconut extract"".  I can only hope that when coconut prices level out, this brand will return to its formerly excellent quality.",Neutral
"I bought these because I heard that Thai Kitchen uses BPA. Well, maybe so, but Thai Kitchen was Thick (at least 50%) and sweeter/tastier, so this doesn't compare, in my opinion.<br /><br />It is a good product, but after trying Thai Kitchen, it doesn't live up... I wish Thai Kitchen stops using BPA soon and they make it clearly known to public!",Neutral
"The Good:  Organic, BPA free, nice coconut flavor<br />The Bad:  Very runny, lower fat content than other coconut milk<br /><br />If you want organic and BPA free, this may be the only option.  If you are willing to give up one or the other, there are better options.",Neutral
"I don't care about dented cans, it should not affect the great quality of the product. (I buy this brand of coconut milk exclusively) I would not typically care about a dent here or there but of the case ONLY TWO were NOT dented. These cans look worse than any can you see on the ding bins at the grocery mart. The price is great but they should just list it as dented, clearly they get rid of the dented stock through amazon sales.",Neutral
"I have mixed feelings about this product.  We have ordered it three times now through subscribe and save.  With the first order, we were 100% satisfied.  The coconut milk had a beautiful taste and texture.  With the second box, the quality of the product was just gross.  Coconut ""milk"" is absolutely the wrong word.  At least 80% of the can was solidified.  When I shook the can, I could hear no movement of liquid whatsoever.  I already had a few cans of coconut cream in the cupboard and didn't need a dozen more!  I continued to use it since the flavor was fine and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it.  With our third order (what can I say, I'm an optimist!), there were still some solids but much less than our second order.<br /><br />It does not seem to matter whether the box states it originated in Thailand.  All three of our orders said they were from Thailand, yet they were of drastically different quality.",Neutral

It tastes OK to me, but I don't know for sure that its safe.

I use canned clams because I no longer live in the northeast. I use them for linguine with clam sauce. I found Crown Prince chopped clams more like minced than chopped. Also they were packed in water rather than clam juice. I had to add bottled clam juice to make it better.

"These chopped clams are good- not great, but good. I add them to canned clam chowder to boost the protein content, and they are quite adequate for that.

"My daughter was put on the orange goodstart at birth.  But after going through several long nights, and her screaming bloody murder before she'd potty (she went two days without going potty), her doctor switched over to this formula.  She never spit up and she burped much easier on this. She started pooping 2-3 times a day. Although it was still hard balls, she didn't scream and it didn't smell as bad. Her dr. said she's still constipated and that is why her poop is so hard. So they have switched her yet again to the natural cultures in the green can. She's only been on it for 24 hours and has already started showing gas signs and has been spitting up all evening. Not sure if she just needs time to adjust or what. I know with the blue soy she seemed to have been doing much much better.<br />Only thing I dont like about the soy formula is the greasy residue it leaves in the bottles. You have to let them soak in hot water in order to clean them properly.",Neutral
THESE ARE REALLY GOOD TASTING! So what does that mean is that they are not very healthy - not to many things taste this good and good for you.  I use them as a treat. Lots of sugar and syrup.

I had high hopes for this popcorn but it underwhelmed.  It has nice heat but the flavor is a little boring.  So far my favorite spicy microwave popcorn is the Pain is Good brand- hot.  I've yet to try their two other flavors.,Neutral
"Dave's Gourmet is probably the hot foods brand I hold in the highest regard so I was hoping that the Popcorn would be every bit as good as their sauces and Dave's Burning Nuts. Insanity Popcorn is spicy but without a lot of flavor. It lacks really much definition, its really buttery, or smokey. Instead its somewhat salty with a lingering heat. Its reasonably spicy but without insanely hot or great flavor (or both), its mostly novelty.  On paper it sounds like a great idea but I don't think popcorn is probably the best delivery mechanism for hot foods sadly.  Its not bad but its not great either.

"I purchased this item to save on calories and carbs.  I primarily use this syrup to make mochas, smoothies and hot chocolate.  I agree that if tasted straight from the bottle this has a bitter, sour taste.  However for what I am using it for it works out great.  I must admit I do add Splenda to sweeten it up but it does add the chocolate flavor I am looking for and once mixed with the other ingredients the bitterness and sour flavor disappears.  This is an item that will stay in my kitchen.",Neutral

"One thing you'll notice from having this tea, right off the bat is the larger size of the tea leaves, and how much tea is in the bag itself. I went back to the market and have since bought 3 more boxes of tea from different brands, and quality and size are easily noticeable; Stash PGT's leaves actually look like leaves, and not burnt up, shriveled sawdust. They leaves also have a pretty color, and aren't oxidized.<br /><br />Since I grew up on sugar laden drinks, drinking both teas without sugar was rough, but now that I'm used to it, these teas are just super tasty and don't even need a grain of sugar. I also cold brew my tea, rather than pour warm/scalding/hot water on it. I was reading on a forum that brewing teas in cold water helps to draw out more antioxidants. Cold brewed black tea is better for you than hot brewed oolong, believe it or not. Also, I can't stomach the flavor of warm/scalding/hot water tea. It's just...bleh. Cold-brewing tea is similar to making sun tea, except, it isn't placed in the sun. I ""brew"" my tea from anywhere between 15 min to 30 min.<br /><br />~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~<br /><br />Stash is a great starter tea if you've never seriously drunk tea before. After tasting around a bit, this tea is not really as good as I thought it was...Taste around, it's the only way you'll know if somethings really good or not~",Neutral
"The fragrance is strong and floral - lovely.  The tea is dark golden brown  and much more like a fermented Oolong than green tea.  I didn't like it at first, because it lacks the gentle subtlety of the blend of green and jasmine.  It's almost like an afternoon tea with jasmine added.  Over time, this tea has grown on me, and I like that it is a bit stronger than a typical jasmine green.  However, when I want that delicate flavored, I look for something else, even the Bigelow (and I'm not a great Bigelow fan).",Neutral
"I love this tea, but I find the new box design annoying.  I don't really like the photos on the boxes and I have gotten two different types, this one and the Hazelnut one and both of them had flaps that ripped and they don't stand upright like the other style did, the old style with no picture.  I don't know why this is, but it bothers me enough to tell others about it.",Neutral
"I bought this tea because my husband loves the double bergamot from Stash. I'd been drinking Tazo brand, and I have to admit that Tazo is quite a bit better. This one is not strong enough for me, and I can't taste the mint as much as I can in the Tazo.",Neutral

The cinnamon is fairly dominant but counterbalanced quite well by the green tea flavor, even though Stash did use cinnamon oil.<br /><br />I was a little scared about the cinnamon after my unpleasant experience with Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea, which was ruined by too much cinnamon oil.<br /><br />After I use up these six boxes I do not know if I will purchase anymore Stash tea.<br /><br />Stash needs to hold off on using the spice oils (especially the cinnamon), even though it isn't so offensive in this particular tea, they could still tone it down a bit more.",Neutral
"I only drink green and white variety of tea (no fruit mixes), however this tea didn't have any taste and was slight improvement on having hot water.",Neutral
"Had this been labeled ""green tea with a touch of pomegranate and raspberry essence"" I might have rated this higher.  However, the name is pomegranate raspberry and I therefore expected those vary flavors.  The overall taste is mild and muddled.  I except a greater sweetness.  The tea's second ingredient, chamomile, has a distinctive presence.  While I didn't find the flavor to be unpleasant, there is nothing about it that would make me reach for it over one of my other teas.",Neutral
"I love Stash mint green & white teas but this is not my favorite variation. It's much better over ice than warm so I think I'll use my purchase to make lots of iced tea. To be fair, it's a high quality tea. I think I really wanted a real mojito.",Neutral
I picked up some of this tea at the grocery store last week. It has some grassy aftertaste that many green teas have but not as much as some brands. I was careful with water temp and how long I let it steep and it wasn't bitter. It tastes somewhat clean and fresh but I like the much less expensive Salada better and I don't have to be careful with it like I do with Stash teas.,Neutral
"At first, I thought that this product deserves 4 or 5 stars.  What changed my mind?  ADVANTAGES:  (1)Most of the crabmeat in the can is adequate-quality white crabmeat but the top layer of the can is extremely high quality red-colored whole legs of small crabs.  Overall, the quality of the crabmeat in this product is higher than any other non-lump crabmeat product.  Only the very expensive cans of ""lump"" crabmeat have higher quality contents than this Chicken of the Sea product.  (2)This product can be conveniently opened with a can opener.  No need to worry about splatter.  DISADVANTAGES:  (1)The quantity of crabmeat is just mediocre.  After draining away the water by squeezing the opened can, the crabmeat is only at about 60% of the altitude of the can in this Chicken of the Sea product.  That's better than Roland Consul brand Crab Meat, which goes below 50%, but not as good as other brands of canned crabmeat which can end up at about 70% to 80% of the altitude of the can.  (2)The other disadvantage is that Chicken of the Sea makes the mistake of putting a piece of transparent paper at the bottom of the can which clings to the crabmeat.  Each time I open a can of this product, I first enjoy eating the high quality crabmeat but then I eventually end up suffering the inconvenience of licking the crabmeat off of the paper.  My fingers will end up having lots of crabmeat clinging to it and the bottom of the can will end up with some residual crabmeat which needs to be scraped with a fork or spoon.",Neutral

These bars taste ok.  They are edible and similar to a rice krispy treat but less sweet.  The problem with these bars are the fact that they way too small for the price.

I contacted the seller and he replaced it with another, but the expiration date was exactly the same on the second bag.  I returned the second bag and I'm waiting for a credit on my account.  I would not order this item from this seller again. This item was ordered from Wag.com, not Amazon.",Neutral

"The chocolate taste is definitely there, along with the oatmeal and raisin. The raisin taste is less noticeable, so the overall flavor is quite bland with the bitterness of dark chocolate/cocoa. Some people might like these semi non-sweet taste, but I really dislike the weird chocolate taste and the aftertaste of slight bitterness. It's not dry at all, but mostly chewy.<br /><br />All in all, I would not buy this product at all simply based on the taste. I would rather eat other nutritional bars, such as Cliffs, Lara, and  granola bars.",Neutral
"My palate tends to be open to health foods and I really like the flavor of the Oatmeal Raisin bars. Their texture is not as dry as the Cranberry Orange bars, but it is still dry enough to require having a drink at hand<br /><br />Flavor analysis: The cinnamon dominates in a pleasant way. It is not as hidden by the cocoa or whole grain flours as in the Orange Cranberry bars. I enjoy this flavor more than the Orange Cranberry, which is a switch for me.<br /><br />Texture: Best described as slightly powdery.<br /><br />Miscellaneous: These could actually do with a little less sweetener. They seem sweeter than the Orange Cranberry.<br /><br />Final Analysis: I can deal with the texture, but if I want a healthy snack, I would prefer that I didn't get that sugar rush feel. They are a decent size and have only 200 calories. That was a nice surprise. Even though the cocoa powder doesn't quite dominate in these bars, it is the second contender in flavor and think it would be better to market them as ""Oatmeal Raisin Cocoa"" bars.",Neutral
"I really enjoyed these and was surprised at how much they remind me of a ""normal"" chocolate-oatmeal-raisin cookie. But I don't really feel they should be called nutrition bars, as while they have 28% RDA of dietary fiber per bar, they have only 4g of protein, 4% RDA of calcium and 8% RDA of iron, and that's it; no other vitamins/minerals. When I hear ""nutrition bar"" I'm expecting a bit more than that. Even so, they are tasty and filling and only 200 calories per bar so I'll buy some from time to time for those ""rushed mornings"" when a decent breakfast is impossible.",Neutral
"These are Oatmeal Raisin nutrition bars, designed for a healthy snack or when you don't have time for breakfast.<br /><br />Overall, these are rather dry and they do crumble easily if you drop your lunch bag. The oatmeal and raisins are the main flavor, but if there is cocoa in them, it's not very much. They may be healthy for you, but they could definitely use some more flavor in them. They are an OK snack or breakfast substitute or when you just need something to tide you over till your next meal.",Neutral
"I have eaten about 100 different type of food bars over the years since I don't always have time for breakfast or to leave work for lunch so when I saw these I wanted to try them out.  The picture on the box makes them look almost like a no bake cookie with lots of big oats and texture, but when I had my first one I was a bit disappointed since it was really more like a chocolate flavored sugar cookie with almost no texture.  The actual taste is mainly just a chocolate taste and the oatmeal and raisin might just barely come through on some bites.  I don't hate them, but they are certainly not my top pick.",Neutral
"Im nibbling one on of these as I'm typing.  I like the taste, chocolatey, nutty, a standard 1.8 oz weight, long flat shape.<br /><br />However, the downside of these bars.  While it's a good taste, it's just simply not that filling.  The consistency is very light.  The light and airy taste doesn't leave me very satisfied after I've eaten it -- I want more substance.",Neutral
They're good breakfast/snack bars... but they're very dry compared to the blackberry flavor. I probably won't be purchasing the strawberry again.,Neutral

While they are quite tasty (yes, I will be finishing the bag!), the expectation was that there was actually going to be pomegranate as the main ingredient. The name is misleading and, like many food companies, this seller is jumping on the bandwagon of adding the smallest amount of the fruit in the mix and using its name in the title. The pomegranate juice concentrate is mixed with several other fruit juices, and there is no indication on the package of how much pomegranate is actually in there. Trader Joe's version is actual pomegranate arils covered in a small amount of chocolate - definitely could qualify as a ""healthier"" treat option. These, unfortunately, do not. Quite tasty, but don't kid yourself on any health benefits here - too much sugar! FYI: 180 calories and 26 grams of sugar in ¼ cup (about 16-20 nuggets).",Neutral

I am glad many people love it, and can't say for sure why I don't, but it will not be my tipple, either to buy again, or to give away.

"Just received my order of 2 boxes of 10 podz each. I bought Columbian Supremo. I have a Senseo pod coffee maker.<br /><br />When I put my first podz in the Senseo, I thought ""Gee the podz looks a little small"". I was right. The podz was too small to be pressed tight so some of the hot water bypassed the podz. I could see right away that it was coming out weak.<br /><br />I don't give up easily. I put the second podz in a make-your-own plastic pod container. I had to stuff it in a little but it fit and sealed well so all the hot water went through the coffee podz instead of bypassing it. The coffee came out much stronger by sight.<br /><br />Now for a review of the taste which is obviously very subjective. First I should say that I like strong coffee (ever since a trip to Europe several years ago). Strangely, I do not particularly like Starbucks coffee because it seems bitter to my taste. Judging by the millions of Starbucks devotees my taste preference is not in the majority. Well if you like Starbucks you will probably like the podz flavor. It seems a little bitter. Now of course this is only one flavor so I don't know about other flavors.<br /><br />If the vendor is monitoring this review, he/she should change the podz description to qualify which coffee makers can use these podz.",Neutral

The inner pouch isn't microwaveable, so the product must be squeezed out into a bowl before heating (it tends to cling to the pouch a little, too).",Neutral
"Very easy to heat up and stores for a long time at room temperature.  It's a relatively tasty and easy meal, but if you eat the whole package (as I do), you've already consumed enough salt for the day.  I'll probably avoid it in the future for that reason alone.",Neutral

The organic does not have artificial flavor in the ""original caffeine free"" flavor, but it is not nearly as strong.  Maybe that is the effect of the artificial ingredient.

"Review update - 7/12/2012<br />I'm sad to say that the new, purple box packaging for this tea contains artificial flavors.  Why, oh why, did Good Earth have to change this tea, when it was perfectly fine and good the way it was?  I am terribly disappointed by this change, and have amended my star rating to reflect this.<br /><br />Original Review - 10/4/2010<br />First, to the Natural/Artificial concerns - it really does say Natural Flavors in the ingredient list, NOT artificial as some of the reviews state.  Box also states ""No sugar, caffeine, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives"".  I've submitted a picture of the ingredients list to Amazon, which you can view at the top of this item page.<br /><br />Ingredients list:<br />Red Rooibos, Chicory Root, Natural Flavor, Rosehips, Cinnamon, Lemongrass, Peppermint, Papaya, Chamomile, Panax Ginseng Leaves, Anise Seed, Dandelion Root, Ginger Root, Orange Oil, Orange Peel.<br /><br />I was given my first box of this tea by a friend who knew I liked cinnamon tea.  Up to that point, my favorite tea was Celestial Seasonings' Bengal Spice.  But when I tried Good Earth, I fell in love!  Now I cannot find it anymore in any of the local stores that carried it, so I signed up for the regular shipments from Amazon.<br /><br />Everyone I have shared this tea with tell me how much they enjoy it, that it hardly seems possible for tea to have such intense flavor and not need sweetening.  I have to be sure to get some before my husband & kids finish the box without my getting a chance to have a few myself!  Seems like every time I visit my mom now, she makes up some of this for us to share as some iced tea.<br /><br />I do not use any sweetener, which says a lot because I use sweetener with pretty much every other kind of herbal tea I drink.  Good Earth is great hot or cold, and it sure does give my tastebuds a gingerbread-like warmth on a fall or winter morning.  There is no tea-ish, bitter taste or aftertaste.<br /><br />If you love cinnamon, gingerbread, or a really good caffeine-free tea that doesn't need sweetening, give this one a try!",Neutral
"This tea is probably my very favorite tasting tea ever! It is delicious hot or cold, and has a sweetness all its own so it does not need added sweetener.<br /><br />So why only 3 stars?? Because I have discovered that, for me and some others I know, panax ginseng is a major stimulant. Knowing that it is caffeine free I had a small glass of this tea iced one evening. That night I barely slept a wink. At first I didn't make the connection, but then I remembered that my husband has the same reaction to ginseng (and he's a person who can drink full-caf coffee at night and have no trouble sleeping).<br /><br />I now drink it only before noon, and that seems to be okay. Ginseng may not be stimulating to everyone, but I just wanted to mention it for those who may be like me.<br /><br />I notice that Good Earth's *Organic* Original does not have ginseng listed in the ingredients, so that may be a viable alternative.",Neutral

Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now.",Neutral

I usually have to run it under hot water for a few minutes, which is not a big deal but just one more step.  Also, the price is very high for what this is.  I could use a second one but at this price I'll make due with the one I've got.",Neutral

"My wife and I are vegetarian, and after a lot of research decided to start feeding our dog this kibble. Afterall, dogs can clearly survive on vegan diets, as long as they are nutritionally balanced.

We are not super militant vegetarians, so this wasn't the end of the world for us.  Our mantra is minimize.<br /><br />Don't misunderstand me; I've read many good things about this veggie kibble, and there are many stories of people feeding their dog this food for many years with no problems.  So, by all means try it out.  I'm glad we did, and in all honesty I wish we could keep feeding it.  However, I only write my story so that people can be aware that this may not work for all dogs.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After a few bags of the Blue Buffalo Wilderness, we switched again to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CICX6"">Prairie Chicken Meal & Brown Rice Medley Dry Dog Food by Nature's Variety, 30-Pound Bag</a> and have been feeding it for around 6 months now.

I really like this stuff but was a little annoyed that in 2 of my vials the product had solidified.  I don't know if water got in there or what but I got less than I paid for.  I will still buy Zipfizz I just hope I've seen the last of the solidified product.  It was rock solid - there was no getting it out and still using it.,Neutral
"This product works but the advertising is misleading. Zipp Fizz claims that it's a natural product and on its website says that it is sweetened with xylitol.  Xylitol is a natural sugar made from the birch tree, and used in Europe for over 100 years.  I use xylitol on a regular basis and agree that if it comes from the right source and not from China, where it's made from corn, it is healthy and has very good side effects such as cavity prevention.  But,on the ingredients list, xylitol is the last ingredient, meaning, that it is the smallest ingredient in the formula.  On the other hand Sucralose (also known as Splenda) is very high on the list of ingredients.  That's where the aftertaste is from.  If you don't care what you put in your body then this is a good product as it does work as advertised.  Why add Splenda if the xylitol is in there? Because the splenda is cheaper. So obviously there is no need for the xylitol other than to use it as a marketing ploy.  They know this and have told me that their new product - immune fizz - has no Splenda.  Why not take it out of the regular zipp fizz too and make it healthier too?  I was sucked into the purchase by the xylitol reference only to find the sucralose in the product.  I wonder what else they aren't saying?",Neutral
"I don't feel like I represent the general masses, but the grape is definitely NOT the best flavor out there.  In fact, I'd say it's maybe 3rd best.  The taste was just mundane to me.  I like the fact that the other flavors have a little bit of sweet/tart flavor to them so I don't feel like I'm drinking sugar-free Kool-Aid or Crystal Lite.  I would suggest that first time drinkers go with the Pink Lemonade, Berry, or Orange Soda.",Neutral
"Well, I like it.  Everyone is different.  I'm an energy freak and have tried MANY, so when I say I like it, it means the energy it gives is good enough no jitters and the taste is so much better than others i've tried.  My boyfriend tried it and the first thing he did was spit it right back out..lol...like I said everyone is different.",Neutral
"There was this one energy drink I had been buying from Wal-mart.  It was the only place I could find it.  Then one day, it was pulled from the shelf in every single Wal-mart within an hours drive.  And that's a lot of Wal-marts!  This energry drink was quite possibly the best I had ever and will ever taste.  I could get a 10-pack for $1.50.  That price just couldn't be beat and it tasted great too.  The only place you can get it now is from a somewhat shady looking website that sells 10-packs for like $15.  So there I was energy drink-less.  I started looking online for alternatives and I came across Zipfizz.  I figured I'd check some local stores for small packs to sample and give it a try.<br /><br />I purchased this product as somewhat of a ""blind buy.""  I had tried the orange, citrus, and pink lemonade by purchasing small three packs at some of the local stores.  However, I wanted to try the grape and the berry.  The only way I was going to be able to do that was to buy them online.  So I went for the berry.  About the best I can say is it's not horrible.  Just like the others I had tried, it had a very strong B-vitamin taste to it.  It was very overpowering in this flavor.  Having tried those other flavors, I would have to say this is probably my least favorite.  As for the rest, the orange is definitely top notch.  There's hardly any B-vitamin taste to it as it is masked by the orange flavor.  The orange sort of reminds me more of orange popsicles or an orange flavored drink than it does of an actual orange.  But it's still pretty good.  The same can be said for citrus, it covers the B-vitamin flavor well.  It has a similar taste to the orange, but it tasted like there was some lemon and lime mixed in there.  It was pretty good.  The pink lemonade is pretty good, if you can get past the fact that it's a fizzy drink.  And that's exactly what it tasted like, a fizzy pink lemonade.  It just had a minor B-vitamin after taste to it.  I haven't yet tried the grape, but would still like to.  After my experience with the berry though, I'm not hopeful.  Orange is good enough for me for now and I've actually found it cheaper locally in the big 20-pack.",Neutral

"I fed my two golden retrievers and cat Wellness products for a long time with good results. I really respect the approach Wellness has tried to take and always thought their ingredients were excellent.  Their ingredient list is outstanding-- human grade meats and veggies/ a holistic health approach.<br /><br />Then we had a strange incident. I opened a new bag and gave it to my dog, and shortly after eating breakfast she became terribly sick for about a week---severe, severe diarrhea. I thought this was a weird coincidence, so I discarded the bag just to be safe, and went through another bag of Wellness with no problems. Then about a month later I again opened a fresh bag and my dog became terribly ill shortly after eating the first bowl-- same symptoms.  (Both bags were not expired.)<br /><br />I can't help suspecting that something about how the ingredients were mixed in those bags made my dog terribly sick. I stopped feeding Wellness to my pets and we have had no further problems over the last 6 months. I should add that my dog had never had any allergy problems of any kind and has always been very healthy. She has never had a bad reaction to any food-- she is a chow-hound and does not have a sensitive system.<br /><br />I reported our experience to the store where I purchased the food and they agreed to notify Wellness. I don't know if the company has looked into this issue or not.<br /><br />If your dog stays healthy on Wellness I would still support it as a good choice given the ingredient list. However, if your dog has symptoms like my dog's symptoms, I'd suggest to you take that seriously and switch foods.",Neutral

"Package arrived in time.  I was expecting the salt to be finely ground - which to me means something powdery.  The salt was more like rock salt - the crystals being slightly larger than what you find in kosher salt.  I have to dilute it with water before I can consume it.  If you sprinkle it on a salad or similar semi dry food, you will feel the crystals, which is an unpleasant experience because it feels like you have sand in your food.  This salt is not like regular salt that dissolves easily with little moisture/liquid. The package it is in is also labeled ""finely ground"".<br /><br />I use it for cooking - where I have no problems with it.

It is very separated (part solid, part liquid) and it was difficult to blend it to a smooth consistency.  Overall - 3 stars - decent product for the price",Neutral
The white Jasmati rice is not as aromatic or flavorful as the white Basmati rice.

"i just got my Gourmet Popcorn Variety 3-pack (45 oz per pack) and wanted to make sure that other potential purchasers were aware of what they were buying.  There are three plastic bottles of popcorn in the package.  Each bottle contains 15 ounces of popcorn for  a total of 45 ounces for the entire order.  When I ordered the popcorn, I thought I was getting 3 45 ounce containers.  This would be a little over 3 dollars per pound which is reasonable for gourmet popcorn.  Instead this works out to somewhat more than 10 dollars per pound.  I considered returning it, but as a popcorn lover, I decided to keep it.  I may amend my review after popping some of it to see if it's worth the price.",Neutral
"Pros:<br />The popcorn itself is good. My kids and I love popcorn so we like trying different varieties.<br />Able to mix different types together in the same batch for contrasting flavors and texture.<br />Works very well in an oil popper.

It's likely you can find something very similar to this in a local store (I got a similar 3-pack at Target last year) for a similar price, and will save on the shipping.<br /><br />Overall, it's good. It's just not a good value because of the shipping costs.",Neutral

It is the amongst the FRESHEST rice we've ever purchased (and we've purchased from the source).  It has a wonderful taste and aroma.  After cooking several batches, both on the stove and in our Zoji Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker, we like it, but find the texture to be just okay.  We've had better textured varieties in the past.  The grains are on the short side for ""long grain"" and they explode a little too much, even when we used less water.  It is very good, for brown rice; just not quite as good, for brown basmati.  We would buy it again, but not as our only source of brown basmati.",Neutral

If you prefer the taste of white rice over brown, you may like this rice.<br /><br />I only make my rice on stovetop, using stainless steel cookware on an electric stove. If you use that method of rice cooking and use the suggested amount of water on the jar, it will turn out mushy. Using 1 c rice and 1 1/2 c water works much better.",Neutral
The taste was not that incredible. It lacks some creamy taste. The ingredients also could be improved. Too much potatoes.,Neutral
"It's thick and has a very good amount of potatoes, just how I like it. But it's SO BLAND. I had to add salt and pepper to it, and it didn't help much. It doesn't taste like much of anything, and there is very little pieces of clam in there. It wasn't completely disappointing because the clams that WERE in the soup tasted good. Only about 2 bites out of the whole can did I notice it being gritty. I also discovered no black potatoes.",Neutral
"I love campbell's new england clam chowder but I can never find it in the small cans locally, so I was very happy to see it here on amazon.

An individually wrapped red, soft hot dog steeped in a vinegar-based hot sauce.<br /><br />The heat and tang are good, but the consistency is a bit too soft for me.  I'd love them if they were a bit less mushy and didn't mention the organ meat on the label.

"too mild, bland and watery. i eat a can of sardines every day, so i buy them by the case right here on amazon.  my favorites so far are crown prince brisling sardines and cento skinless and boneless, both in olive oil or extra virgin olive oil.  However, i do try and will continue to try and compare.  ""wild planet wild sardines"" to me are just...okay.",Neutral
"Pros: Got this for about $2 per can with Amazon's subscribe and save. Cheap considering it is packed in olive oil. Packed with 3 large sardines with skins and bones for extra nutrients.<br /><br />Cons: Where is the flavor? I have tasted various canned sardines. I can occasionally tell the differing flavor characteristics that each brand seems to have. Some taste very smokey. Others seem to take in the taste of the olive oil they are packed in. One brand I noticed had a lemony aftertaste. I actually prefer strong tasting fish but I can find that I appreciate each brand and really haven't found one I wouldn't buy again.  Until now. I wouldn't mark in in the dislike column. More towards the didn't really prefer. After a brief almost non-existent smoke taste, the fish itself is flavorless. It is also dry. The olive oil seemed to impart no flavor or moisture to this product. I had to pile on the hot sauce to get through the first two cans (I usually plop one can over rice as a quick snack). Plus this product was processed in Vietnam.<br /><br />Conclusion: I bought 12 cans. Definitely will shop for other brands due to the bland flavor of this product. But for the excellent price, I will still give it 3 stars. I wouldn't say I didn't like it. It is just canned sardines. Just pile on your choices of salt, spices, and sauces. Then chow away.",Neutral
"After reading the reviews I was interested to try these. I am enjoying my first tin at this moment. When I opened it, I said, that reviewer was right. They were very casual about filling the tin. Three not that large sardines floating in a LOT of oil, room for at least two more sardines. I dont think I will be buying these again unless it turns out this one can was a fluke and the others are more full. The smoky flavor is nice, but its not enough to make up for the insufficient quantity. My favorite brands are Season and Crown Prince.

One package makes enough to feed 2-3, but if you are like me and have to feed five you'll need to use more than one box, which it does have instructions for on the box.

It almost gave me a canker sore. I tasted nothing except lemons, felt like I was sucking on one too.<br />Tried to contact the company twice and NO one responded. Wanted to know if they had recalls for their food. Apparently they do have recalls but not for the pea, pears and spinach. Still trying to get in touch with them so they know that it was sour and maybe try to fix it. I plan to stick to Earth's Best at the moment until they get their act straight or finally contact me.<br />A month later...<br />I finally got a response from the rep and they are sending coupons so I can replace the boxes I bought.

"For the past few months, my local Dollar Tree has been carrying various versions of Rockstar. This delighted since I drink it regularly. I was even more so delighted to come across some Rockstar coupons which brought the price down to 45 cents a can when bought at Dollar Tree. I stocked up. Eventually they started running out of Original Rockstar, which is what I usually drink. I needed to stock up again and didn't want to pay full price, so I grabbed a few of these sugar free versions to hold me over until they got more original in stock.<br /><br />I do not like them at all as much as the original and here is why -<br /><br />  The sugar free version has that diet soda taste, which I kind of expected, but was hoping it wouldn't have.<br /><br />  It also has a little less carbonation. One of the things I love about original Rockstar is that it has that powerful,<br />  crisp carbonation, so I really miss it with the sugar free.<br /><br />  I find that the sugar free version actually bloats me alot more than the original.<br /><br />I have become pretty much immune to Rockstar as far as energy goes, but I love the taste (of the original) and so I drink one every morning, just like other people drink coffee. I suppose I am ""addicted"" to it just like people are ""addicted"" to coffee, too.<br /><br />If you don't mind the diet soda taste, or if you have tried original Rockstar and think it's too strong, you would probably like these quite well.

"Stevia is kind of funny. Brands and batches vary. Sometimes you get a batch that isn't very sweet or has more of an aftertaste (bitterness). Usually, I only have to use 1/16 of a tsp of NOW Stevia to sweeten my morning coffee. The batch I received this time is weak, so I have to use twice as much. (Thank goodness it isn't bitter though.) So it goes with using a natural sweetener. The leaves from which this batch of stevia was extracted must not have had a very high concentration of rebaudiana. I strongly believe that the manufacturer should test out each batch made for quality before packaging it so customers aren't disappointed. Oh, well, better luck next time.

One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.

They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.",Neutral
Ok so my cat loves the flavor will eat them like they are going out of style. HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.,Neutral
My wife's cats love all the temptation treats.  They will eat these becuase they are gluttons but it is obvious they are not that keen to the taste or the way it makes them feel.<br /><br />I noticed no difference with hairballs using these treats.  If you need something for the hairballs get the brown barley or malt paste.  That stuff works real good and some cats actually like the taste.,Neutral
"Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.",Neutral

The germination rate was good and the grass was very nice.<br /><br />My cats (and my dog) love it and I also gave some to the neighbor who also loved it.<br /><br />The product itself is good - they just need to have better packaging.

It popped quickly in my Whirly-Pop popper and the kernels were a nice, appealing yellow color.  As stated in their description, these are tiny, tiny kernels that produce tiny, tiny popcorn.  They were fairly tender and tasty but a bit chewy.  They are supposed to be ""hullless.""  I'm not sure I agree with that but it is true that the hulls don't pop off and land in the bottom of the bowl.  The hulls stick to the kernels which is what makes them sort of chewy.  I will use these up but I probably won't buy more.  Kids may like the tiny kernels more than I did. I found them messy to eat because I kept dropping them.  My dog loved the ones I dropped!

The traps are mostly functional but the wires that engage the trigger are too soft so they bend easily and are not of uniform length causing them to bend while setting and tripping.

"I'll be honest, I'm a bit lazy when it comes to things like hot chocolate.  I really enjoy hot chocolate, who doesn't? The issue is I seem to crave it when I'm so comfortable on the couch after a long day and don't feel like warming up milk, mixing in cocoa, sugar, and a touch of salt to get delicious hot cocoa.  So where does this leave me?  I could, for about 20 cents per packet, get swiss miss hot chocolate packets and dump it in water and drink it, is it delicious? Not really, but I get my fix.  Problem is, you have to heat the water, pour in the powder, mix it, and deal with the clumps and clean up.  Not my favorite thing to do at 930pm (do your best to not think I'm completely worthless).  Now that I have a keurig, I thought this would fix everything AND give me great hot cocoa.  Well, I do have convenient, clean, easy to prepare hot cocoa, but its...about as good as swiss miss.  So yes, it does satisfy my fix, and at only 70 cals and 5 g sugar, I can deal with that as well.  I'm sure if mixed a little land o lakes low fat half and half in there it would be significantly better.<br /><br />I'm astonished by all these negative reviews of k cups in general, the idea behind k cups was convenience, not necessarily the BEST beverage available.  Lets be honest, using a burr grinder, fresh beans, and a french press  = best coffee ever, loose leaf teas and kettle of water = best tea ever, and the aforementioned steps to hot cocoa from scratch = best hot cocoa ever.  The problem is, all of these methods require time to be spent on ourselves, something our society so heavily frowns upon.  With my keurig, I wake up, walk down stairs, have a true American sized variety of well marketed beverages, pop one in, and have piping hot average to above average coffee and teas in less than 30 seconds.  So if you want GREAT beverages, make it yourself.  If you want GOOD beverages that are convenient and clean, get a keurig and lower your expectations a smidge!",Neutral

At first I thought that one of the canisters had opened during shipping, but all of the foils were intact, so I have no idea where all the coffee powder came from.<br /><br />Outside of that, the coffee is good, the shipping was super fast, and the cost is better than the grocery stores.

"I have tried a few varieties of these ECC capsules in my CitiZ machine so far and will submit separate reviews under the different product listings over the coming few days.<br /><br />What's common to all of these capsules is that the CitiZ machine is a little more difficult to close when using an ECC capsule versus a Nespresso capsule. Also, before the espresso starts coming out of the machine, the capsule makes a bit of a popping. Both of these issues are addressed on ECC's website, where they try to assure customers that this is normal and should not cause any concern.<br /><br />So, on to this particular variety, the Espressivo.  I'm a little surprised by the other reviews posted so far.  Unless the design of the CitiZ changed drastically, I'm not sure why one of the other reviewers was unable to use the ECC capsule.  As to the flavor, while I agree with the other reviewer so far that it isn't as good as Nespresso's darker roasts, I'm not in agreement that it's nothing more than bad drip coffee.  I actually think the Espressivo ECC capsule tastes okay -- definitely stronger than drip coffee -- and in my CitiZ it produced as much crema as a Nespresso capsule.  Unfortunately, however, the flavor seems kind of ""one note"" compared to my favorite Nespresso capsules.  Given that the cost of the ECC capsules on Amazon isn't that much less than Nespresso capsules available through the Nespresso club (about a 12% cost savings), one has to factor in the ""green"" factor of the ECC capsules to help them decide which capsule to choose.  While I personally feel a lot better about being able to compost the ECC capsules, I also want the best possible flavor from my CitiZ -- that's why I bought it instead of a much less expensive espresso machine.  I'm afraid that unless another variety of the ECC capsules is more to my liking, I'll be sticking with the Nespresso capsules.",Neutral
"I bought a package of these when they first came out.  My initial reaction was the price difference did not justify purchasing these.  The capsules work well.  The flavor of the coffee is good but, there is not as much creama as the Nespresso capsules.  With the new lower prices, these are a good alternative to Nespresso, but they are a compromise.  If you want the best flavor and creama, stick with Nespresso but, if you want a cheaper, almost as good altrnative, give them a try.  I really wish they would package several varieties in one ""intoductory"" package so I could try five varieties without having to buy five fifferent five packs of the same variety.  The descriptions don't give much of a clue as to how the coffe will taste and how strong it is.  If you purchase a five pack and aren't fond of the flavor or intensity, you have a lot of coffee you may not like.  I may try these again although, for now, I'm going to stay with the tried and true (and expensive) Nespresso brand.  Maybe the competition will slow down the frequent price increases from Nespresso.<br />UPDATE:  Prices have come down dramatically on these.  Still not as good as Nespresso originals, but Nespresso's customer service stinks so bad and their prices so high, I'm done buying from them.  These are close and environmentally much friendlier.",Neutral
"An eco-conscious competitor to Nespresso? YAY, I thought, this would be good. And it sort of is.<br /><br />The packaging is great as it gets away from Nestle's use of we-don't-care-about-the-planet metal (aluminum?). Five stars for that.<br /><br />On the other hand, the coffee isn't so great. I bought these without a review and without much information about what type I was buying -- I guess I'm a maverick like that (ha). Although I got them on time, and had apparently purchased an espresso that was considered 4 out of 5 in strength, it really tasted like a 1.5 out of 5 in strength. So, I'm NOT impressed with the coffee -- and I am NOT a coffee expert.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I might try them again if I can find out which espresso is strongest. And, I might try them again because I hate the planet-hating, overpriced monopoly that Nestle has on Nespresso pods... but I gotta say that Nestle's Nespresso pods are tastier.<br /><br />So would some entrepreneur mind doing something about this dilemma?

"Ethical Coffee seems to be the only alternative to Nespresso available in the US (there's another in Europe). The price differential isn't huge (about 20%), but it adds up with everyday use. Nespresso has about a dozen caffeinated styles to Ethical Coffee's two, so those with discriminating tastes will prefer to pay extra for a more precise flavor profile available from Nespresso. To my taste the Ethical Coffee capsule most resembles the Nespresso Capriccio. The Ethical Coffee capsule seems to be biodegradable, which the Nespresso capsule definitely is not.",Neutral

This cereal is high in protein and fiber and uses nutritious whole grains.  The problem is that it has a flat flavor to it.  Adding fruit and sprinkling cinnamon on it make it more palatable.

I bought these, hoping that he would like them and stop sneaking the other kids cheerios, but he seems to prefer the cheerios over these.  He has wheat, peanut, dairy, egg, soy, and oat allergies.  The taste is ok. Not bad. I didn't notice any aftertaste, so that's good.  They are a good quick snack for the car.  He tends to like corn flakes over these though.",Neutral
"This cereal is very healthy (lots of fiber) but it sure doesn't taste very good! I don't understand the people who rave about the taste, maybe they've never tried a great tasting cereal before?

The cereal is all uniform ""pellets"", not crunchy at all.<br /><br />If you want to try good tasting cereal then give Bob's Red Mill's Honey Oatmeal cereal a try. That tastes 10 times better and is probably as healty as this one.<br /><br />If you're trying to solve digestive problems (that's probably why you consider a cereal with Psyllium in the first place), then try some ""Organic Smooth Move"" tea with Senna leafs. That helps with constipation issues.<br /><br />Bottom line, this cereal gets 10/10 for health, but 3/10 for taste. Before you buy the 6-pack based on all the raving reviews, make sure you buy one package first, to see if you like the taste. I pretty much wasted $24. I will go back to Bob's Red Mill's cereal for sure.",Neutral
"I wasn't sure how to rate this product, because the taste of the coffee was very good, but.....I have a Capresso coffee maker which I love and it has problems with the beans.  The beans are too oily for my machine and it has trouble grinding them.  I have used this machine for several years, and this is the only coffee that it had a problem with and I have used it with other flavored coffees.  Again, I probably would have given it a higher rating if not for this factor which is highly personal to my situation.",Neutral
"I suggest ordering the pack with the small glass teapot with one each of 9 different flowering teas first.  Two disk and two balls are packed in each small box.  The ball ones open up in a cuter way.  They should steep longer to get the best flavor out of them but by that time, the tea will have cooled  considerably.  Of the four types, I only liked the taste of the ball with the red blossom.  None of them bloomed as prettily as other brands I have tried.",Neutral

"My son is unique in that he has an allergy to carrots.  It is extremely difficult to find dinner blends that don't contain them!  I looked over the Earth's Best website to find ingredients and picked this product because carrots were lower down on the list of ingredients.  (Some blended in is okay.)  This still had small carrot chunks throughout!  Pulling them out makes this product much less than 6 oz.  My son still likes this product, even if it doesn't agree with him, and I stand by the quality of Earth's Best.  But is it too much to ask for a product without carrots????",Neutral
"My son simply did not like this flavor jar.  He likes peas, spinach and every veggie we've ever given him, but I guess the medley mix was just not tasty enough.",Neutral
"This product was disappointing to me because it contained wheat. There were no ingredients on the product details page but I assumed since it was a vegetable dish it would be okay. My son is not specifically allergic but I don't like to give it to him as he spits up more. So, I'll likely not be getting it again. Also, it's extremely bland and not as good as the fresh stuff I make. But in a bind, it's a good meal I guess.",Neutral

I tried warming it a little in the microwave first and now he will now eat it without a problem. This vegetable medley is not as ""hearty"" tasting as some of the other Earth's Best products. I have found that my son really doesn't like any Earth's Best food, but I'm glad that he will at least tolerate this one.",Neutral

I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.",Neutral
"I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!",Neutral

"I crave 'dried sausage' or droe wors as we call it in South Africa.<br />I usually order from AfricanHut.com.

I bought this droewors when I was craving a taste of home. The other products I bought were great but this wors isn't the best I've ever had. It's a little bit plastic tasting and leaves a sort of coating in your mouth. It's also rather thick; the wors I typically prefer is thinner. Bledie Lekker (which means bloody tasty) isn't the worst I've ever had but it's not my favorite and I'd probably try other brands before buying this one again.,Neutral

"First off, the tea i received was also very fine cut tea, of average quality. In my opinion the red canned Dilmah Supreme is better than this.<br /><br />I might be able to explain why there are different opinions regarding this product. I have bought dilmah tea for many years at a local Mediterranean store. about three years ago they sold the identical green box with the same fine cut leaves in a vacuum packed bag. then the product changed to a better quality course leaf tea, but the box was nearly identical except for a cellophane pane to show the tea leaves and cellophane bag. then dilmah seemed to stop distributing their Ceylon tea, and only marketed their flavor teas of all things. so i turned to amazon for tea.<br /><br />so its possible they are distributing both forms at different times, since it seems they are a bit schizophrenic about their marketing.<br /><br />for the record i bought mine in Dec 2009.",Neutral
"I had great expectations when buying this tea. I have never tried loose leaf Dilmah tea before but I remember very well that wonderful distinctive taste of paper-bag packed Dilmah tea I enjoyed somewhere in the mid 1990th.  First disappointment, it is not loose leaf tea at all. It is minced leaf tea, not loose leaf tea. I guess they sell as ""loose leaf"" the same stuff they pack into paper bags. May be it is more convenient and more profitable for the company but I would not be surprised if somebody sue Dilmah (or Amazon? or ""middle-man"" unitybrandsgroup.com?) for the false advertising since there is no any single mention in the web-site or  on the package that this is CTC tea, and not loose leaf as boldly stated everywhere. Secondly, regarding the taste, there is no resemblance with that exceptional ""mid 1990th"" Dilmah. Now, I would say this is rather average quality CTC tea, sorry if I am saying something unpleasant.  The way I make it is traditional, one tea-spoon of tea per approx. 250 ml of boiling water in ceramic  teapot, and sit for 3-5 min.",Neutral
"Im with the one reviewer who opened the pkg and said WHAT LEAF ? first off, this is a CTC ( cut tear curl) method ....like lipton uses, theres NO LEAF left in this, its all very small 1/8 in peices. With that said, there is a difference between bad tea and delicate tea. This tea has flavor, but its delicate,<br />and certainly wont brew any dark colored cupa tea, NO WAY JOSE ! can it be considered a good morning wake up tea? only by those that have NEVER had a strong cup of tea...caffeine content is weak, but it does works well as a good cheep base for afternoon tea when mixed with flavored green ( citrus, berry etc )Caffine cravers wont get any more kick from this than a green tea, and it wont satisfy anyone looking for a "" robust, strong, flavorful, malty, aromatic, etc "" like all the other reviewers have listed....only thing i can say is either they got another tea than i did, OR they are just plain NUTZ, and/or work for DILMAH",Neutral

The raw rooibos taste, without these ""improvements"" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.

The taste is about the same. Cost wise, also about the same, as the Soda-Club mix comes in a smaller container that you use less of, but with this Syrup you get a lot more, but have to use a little more for the same results.<br />So in the end, if I am already ordering something else from the Soda Club, then I would just use the Cola syrup they sell, otherwise, I would order this syrup.",Neutral

It still does not dissolve completely. Also this is a problem because green tea should be made with water that is about 60 degrees to preserve the best taste...

"As is, Cocoa D'Arriba consists of the best and natural ingredients only; no emulsifier, no artificial Vanillin. Concerning the high quality ingredients and business ethics, these are big pluses. However, as most reviewers have complained, there is barely any taste, let alone the fact that it is not rich or fulfilling for that matter. This is most likely due to the fact that Cocoa D'Arriba is ultra-refined (14 microns) to generate a smooth and mellow taste. That is, the chocolate is over-refined, thus very little has remained from the original rich chocolate taste. You can run into the same problem in olive oil industry, where sometimes the oil is ultra-refined during pressing, which brings about the lack of actual olive taste and thus character. Too sad.<br /><br />I recommend Hachez Orange Bar 77% Cocoa instead, which is certainly a more successful product in the series. The natural orange-oil in it brings about a very mellow yet significant and pleasing orange flavor to this dark chocolate bar. It definitely adds  much flavor and gives some character to this over-refined chocolate bar. It has more taste and after taste.",Neutral
"I like Numi teas, but I found this flavor to be far too strong, and not nearly as minty as I'd expected it to be.<br /><br />Not a bad tea, just disappointing considering the flavor name.",Neutral

"I'm not sure it is as decaffeinated as they pretend and it is kind of a regular black coffee with nothing special or particular flavor.<br />I got a 12 ounce can this week for $1.99 at Safeway. I guess that was a good rebate.<br /><br />Overall, I'm not impressed.",Neutral
"Price and shipping was acceptable but I have sone comments on the pork cracklings:<br /><br />1: They were sort of bland. No seasoning was added.<br />  I had to add some salt and BBQ spice to them.<br /><br />2. Some pieces, (4) in 9 bags, still hair hog bristles on them.<br /><br />3. The pieces were a proper size. Once in a while a huge chunk would be in the bag.<br /><br />4. The texture was very good. Crunchy and chewy.<br /><br />In Comparison with cracklings imported from England, I found yours to be not as rasty.<br />Your price and prompt shipping somewhat offset this. More seasoning is needed in your crackligs.",Neutral
"I love a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I love a good flavored coffee.  When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it.  Caramel-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial, e.g. Ghirardelli Chocolate Caramel flavored coffee.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark.  The Caramel Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no caramel odor and has even less caramel taste.  Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging.  In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup.  This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the caramel flavor.  Because the coffee does have a mild caramel tone, it actually has a bit of a burnt taste.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Caramel Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew.  If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's and put the word ""fusions"" in the search box.  You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards.",Neutral
Great tasting coffee.  Arrived on time in a nicely packaged box.  Enjoyed to the last grind was brewed.  Would recommend this to anyone who like a robust coffee.,Neutral
"Over the years I have tried many different sodas, and since I used to drink <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SBRQ0A"">Hansen Beverage Diet Black Cherry Soda,  12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, I was looking forward to these. The taste did not disappoint, they are genuinely black cherry.<br /><br />They have a more subtle taste than some of the other beans, and while it lingers, it becomes more of a jelly bean (sweeter) losing the full flavor as the bean disolves in your mouth. And while I enjoy the black cherry flavor, I really wouldn't get as excited about this single flavor the way I would some of the others. To put it plainly, I would enjoy it as a part of a mix, but wouldn't go looking for it. Compared to other jelly beans, this would rate a five, but compared to the other beyond gourmet beans, it ranks middle of the pack.<br /><br />If you would like to try it in a mix, I suggest <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBMAS8"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Soda Fountain Mix</a> as a good choice. It not only has this particular flavor, but it also focuses on the other soda flavors. I think you might be happier that way.<br /><br />I originally received a complimentary pack of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E"">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> from the distributor and found them some of the finest jelly beans I have found. If you have not tried any of the flavors, it is a good place to start.",Neutral
"That was my first impression of these treats out of the bag...  dried up owl pellets (yick).  Not that appearances matter all that much if your pet loves the taste but these are big treats and for my small sized dog, that meant I had to break it apart with my hands which was a touch bit unpleasant for moi.<br /><br />As for my dog, he simply didn't care for these at all.  I really wanted him to like them since he turns his nose up to nearly every treat imaginable (including bits of people food, which I don't consider a bad thing) and I'm always looking for ways to create a little variety for him.  Aside from his dog food, the only treats I've found he likes are the soft/chewy Buddy Treats in chicken flavor and dried chicken cutlets (kind of like chicken jerky) which I stopped giving him after an incident last year where he nearly choked on one.<br /><br />I thought these might have been a good replacement for the dried chicken cutlets that he liked so much because I assumed that these would primarily contain one ingredient (chicken) that had been formed into easier to chew treats.  Of course, this is in part my fault for making such an assumption but I'd like to point out there wasn't and currently isn't an ingredient listing available on this product.  The closest reference to what these treats contain are in the following descriptions ""Your dog's instinctive nature is to eat more meat, poultry, or fish protein and less grain... Instinct Raw Boost Bites are grain-free and gluten-free - perfect for satisfying your dog's carnivorous cravings and nutritional needs...  Raw Boost Bites are a pure and healthy treat made from minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients...""  For those of you who may be interested, here is the actual ingredient listing in order as they appear:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.<br /><br />Looks like they're really trying to appeal to a 'natural/holistic' audience and I for one am okay with that - in fact, I try and avoid treats for my dog (and myself!) that contain ingredients I don't know to be 'real' however... had I known these to be the ingredients up front, I'd probably have passed knowing that my dog already turns his nose up to the following food items (turkey, apples, carrots, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, blueberries or persimmons).  There are also quite a few ingredients that I never thought about seeing if my dog would enjoy as well as a few 'questionable to me' ingredients (cloves??)<br /><br />I gave this at least three stars because the ingredient list isn't bad per se, but they should update their product description to include this information and although my dog didn't care for them and I couldn't coax him into a second bite - he did manage to eat a first bite after lots of encouragement.  That's a pretty big deal coming from a dog with as fickle a palate as his.",Neutral
"Another reviewer said these looked like ""hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes"", and aside from the color, I'd have to agree.  Each bite is far too large for an ordinary house cat, and the directions say ""Treat your pet with 1 to 2 Boost Bites per day per 20 lb of body weight.""  My cat weighs much less than 20 pounds, so I cut one of these up into quarters.<br /><br />Well, I tried, anyway.  They don't cut, they crumble.  They seem to have a texture like a fibrous insulation I'd used for soundproofing.  I picked a piece out of the crumbs and dust and fed it to my cat.  He swatted at it a few times then swallowed it whole, even though it was twice as large as his usual treats, which he normally chews.  He wasn't interested in more.  I scooped together a pile of crumbs, added a couple of drops of water, and molded them into a lump.  Wet, he loved it, first chewing up the lump then snuffling up the escaped crumbs.  Right now he's trying to convince me that more testing is needed.<br /><br />The packaging hints at mysterious and wonderful benefits, but I'm a bit doubtful.  It suggests:<br /><br />""Instinct Raw Boost Bites may help promote:<br />*Vitality & energy<br />*Digestive health<br />*Lean muscles<br />Give your pets Instinct Raw Boost Bites and boost their health with the purity of raw food.""<br /><br />The raw ingredients, after chicken and turkey parts, include fruits, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, montmorillonite clay, lettuce and spinach, and dried kelp and sprouts, among other things.  The package goes on to claim:<br /><br />""Our purpose is to empower people to transform the lives of pets.  Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidence of ear infections, and healthier teeth and gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experience.""<br /><br />If there's an amazing pet transformation I'll update my review.  Personally, I'm hoping for an amphibious vehicle, but I'll settle for a dog.<br /><br />These are too large and messy, they require added water to really get the cat interested, and this is a pretty hefty price tag for high maintenance treats, but he does seem to like them once they're wet.",Neutral
"This was listed as a cat treat. On the package it is stated to be for cats and dogs. I got them for my cats and thought it strange that the treat itself was the size of an oreo cookie. It is kind of crumbly like a stale cookie, but filled with real ingrediants like chicken and turkey. I had to crumble it into bite size pieces for my cats. They did eat it, but were less than enthusiastic. They prefer Temptations treats apparently. This would probably work better as a treat for dogs.",Neutral
"My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his treats so finding the right mix can often be difficult. I always have reservations about trying new treats as a large majority of popular dog treats today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new treats so here are my thoughts on Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ High in protein, 40%.<br /><br />+ Minimally processed and freeze dried raw ingredients.<br /><br />+ Dog loved them.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Expensive.  $10 for four ounces is a lot.<br /><br />- High in fat, 34%.<br /><br />- Messy and crumbly texture.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats.  Despite being extremely high in fat content the freeze dried raw ingredients are quite healthy compared to many of treats on the market.  Unfortunately, the high price tag on these treats would make me hesitant about purchasing them on a regular basis.",Neutral
"Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats by Nature's Variety, 4-Ounce Package<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />They're oddly-shaped, greyish-beige, roughly circular pucks about the size of a modern dollar piece around and maybe half an inch thick, that look so thoroughly unappetizing that I immediately gave up all thought of trying a piece of one and reporting on the taste for the sake of art. One look at them from my all-too-human perspective and I had a whole new scale by which to determine how important my art as a reviewer really was to me.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I found the reactions of the three cats I gave these to a surprisingly mixed bag.<br /><br />One, the finnickiest eater that will do anything for a piece of Salisbury steak half the size of your pinky, ate one whole one (which I had to break into quarters) and lost interest halfway through the second one. The second one sniffed at a piece exactly once and walked away, while the skinny and freakish third one that never liked me (they're my roomate's cats, not mine) had a reaction that, translated into words, would have been this more or less:<br /><br />""Hmmm... I see you have that. What is that? interesting... aroma, yes, the word is aroma... intriguing... perhaps even enticing...<br /><br />Where did you get it? Give it to me. Give it to me now!<br /><br />Hmmm... Yeeeeees...<br /><br />You have more, don't you? Good. Give it to me! Give it to me now!<br /><br />[chewing] Yes. I'll submit to your petting me while I eat it (Stay away from the neck!) and maybe, I say *maybe* afterwards if you have a supply of these and can provide me with more of them.<br /><br />[more chewing} You know, I never liked you, not really, not before, but now I see you're really not so bad a fellow after all...""<br /><br />So there it is. A temporary hit. A great big hit and a definite miss on three housecats. They're somewhat expensive for pet-treats but, with the right cat, you could use them to try and teach the basics like, ""come when I say your name"" and ""hiss at someone else.""<br /><br />As far as dogs are concerned, this is going to have to wait until I can overcome the idea of how a stranger might react to my approaching him or her and saying, ""Hey, you don't know me. I don't know you, but I still want to feed this to your dog.""<br /><br />More about that after I get some time to screw up my courage.",Neutral
"I have about 20 cats so gave this product a true test.

When I broke it down for Striper, she ate it all...so did the kittens who even fought over it. But, again, grown cats sniffed and left it alone...<br /><br />Now I feed my cats both dry and canned food and they might be spoiled but given the size and mess of breaking them down into pieces, I wouldn't buy them again...that's my opinion...<br /><br />The cats, like I said could take it or leave it... Probably depends upon their regular diets, but this wasn't a treat in my opinion...",Neutral
My dog loves these treats!  They are a good all natural product which I have no issues or concerns with giving it to my dog.  I feed my dog Wellness Core because he cannot eat grains due to skin allergies.  So to find a good quality grain free treat that my dog likes is great.  I break the treats into 4 pieces because of the cost.  Four ounces for almost 11 dollars is quite costly.  That means these treats are 44 dollars a pound!! I won't be buying much of these treat very often because of the cost.  Sorry Natural Instinct....you have a great product line but 44 dollars a pound is ridiculous!  This isn't filet mingnon people! Five stars for quality 1 star for price = 3 Stars overall.,Neutral
"We have four cats.  Two of them went crazy over these treats and fought with each other to claim every last bit of the treat.  A third one tried them once and never could be induced to try them again, and the fourth refused to have anything to do with them.  Every other cat treat we have brought into the house has always been greeted with unamimous enthusiasm, so I don't really know what to think of this.  Your mileage may vary; for my part, if I am going to pay this kind of money for a cat treat, I want something I know everyone is going to like.",Neutral
"What I find attractive about this product is that the right combination of protein, fat and fiber for your pet. The ingredients read like a list of actual recognizable foods such as plants and animals that you would actually buy in the supermarket rather than a long list of artificial ingredients you would never use in a recipe. Aside from one mineral and one natural preservative, the are things I'd gladly eat myself.<br /><br />The down side of the product is that my cats wouldn't eat it. In fairness, cats can be finicky, and of the three cat treats I have in my house, one cat won't eat any of them. The other likes just one. Obviously I wouldn't buy them, but it's well worth a try especially if you have dogs. If your pet does end up liking them, you can feel good knowing that they are getting real food that a chef might have come up with for their health, rather than something that a laboratory invented.",Neutral
Nature's Variety Snacks seem to have the right ingredients. My dogs were barely interested in the treats.<br />I'm not an animal nutritionist but I've always known that cats need more protein than dogs.<br />Granted this is just a treat but I would think that is why few treats and designed<br />for dogs/cats. I was shocked to realize at the current price these treat cost over $43 per pound.<br />Why not save money and buy your pets Filet mignon or the finest wild Alaskan Salmon.<br />I'm exaggerating of course but I hope you get my point. You could buy a food dehydrator<br />and make your own beef or chicken treats for your pet.,Neutral
"Well, we do not have cats of our own, but our neighbor's cat frequently visits us. I thought it would be nice to feed her something wholesome, organic and healthy from time to time, so we tried the Raw Boost Bites. She didn't like it. Nibbled a bit on it and then spewed it out in disgust. We had more success with the customary tuna fish and ham diet.<br />I have to admit that the sample size of one is not really representative, so I have no idea whether this cat has a special taste, or whether this product is just not what cats want. I may need to try it myself to get a better idea about it ...",Neutral
"I got the chicken flavor and my Rat Terrier loved these, but my cats wouldn't touch them.  They just sat in the cat dish until I had to throw them out. Since I got this because it was supposed to appeal equally to cats and dogs, I'll probably keep hunting for something else.",Neutral
"When I saw Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats in the Chicken flavor, I thought it would be a nice treat for my four indoor cats. I opened it up the very night the package arrived and gave one to each cat. They were interested in these treats at first, licking at them, sniffing them, and one cat even nibbled a little of it. That was the extent of their interest, however. All four treats were still laying on the floor 24 hours later. I've never seen these cats turn their nose up at a treat and they have never left one alone that long.<br /><br />I set cat food on the porch for some of the neighborhood strays, and along with those kitties I see raccoons, skunks, and possums visit my porch every night. I took the four treats my cats turned down and put them on the porch. The next day I found that not even the scavengers liked these treats.<br /><br />The package says these treats are for cats or dogs, so I took the rest of the package to work, where my boss brings his dog every day. CD (the dog) wasn't so sure about the first one, but took it anyway and ate it after looking at it for a bit. After that first one, she ate another right away when she got it and seems to enjoy them without hesitation now.<br /><br />I would say that these are probably not a good buy for your cats, based on my kitties' reactions, but your dog might give it a shot.",Neutral
"The Boost Bites include what appear to be good ingredients: chicken, turkey, and vegetables.  What cat would not like this for a treat?<br /><br />My taste-test focus group consists of four cats.  They range in age from one to eighteen, in weight from eight to thirteen pounds, and include both genders.<br /><br />To test the treats on the focus group, I broke the Bites into cat-size pieces and offered the pieces to the felines on two consecutive days.  On the first try, two of the group ate their pieces, one licked at it but did not eat it, and the fourth cat walked away.<br /><br />I tried again on the second day.  This time, none of them would eat it; they all walked away.<br /><br />Clearly, the Boost Bites may be ok for dogs, but hold little interest for cats.  I suggest that the Bites be sold as dog treats, but not for cats.",Neutral
"I have two Norwegian Elkhounds, one 6 years old and one 6 months old, and a 10 year old cocker spaniel. I am always looking for new treats to use as rewards for them. So, I took up the chance to give these a try.<br /><br />First thing I noticed, is that these treats come in a almost ""health food/gourmet"" type bag leading one to believe that they are an all natural healthy treat. After reading the ingredients they are just like most other treats on the market. There is absolutely nothing special about them. That's ok, dogs like treats.<br /><br />Second the individual treats are fairly large. Even my adult Elkhound who is 50 pounds, I would never give her a full sized treat from this bag. For the ingredients they are just too big.<br /><br />Third, the packaging is made to make it look like the box is plumb full of treats. When in actuality there are not that many treats in the bag at all. But, keep in mind that each treat should realistically be broken up into 3-4 pieces at a minimum.<br /><br />Did the dogs like them? Sure they did, there was no messy ""side effects"" after digestion so that's always a plus. But, at the end of the day the size of the treats, how few there really are, and the ingredients just make this a very average treat. Nothing special here.",Neutral
First of all I used the bites as a treat and not as a substitute for their normal kibble.  I have two dogs one 20 pds and one 30 pds and each dog gets two treats a day.  I typically buy my treats from 3 Dog Bakery or some other high end dog store and over time feel like I know what my dogs like.  As far as giving the bites as a treat they are way too fatty and high in protein to give a whole size bite as a treat (these were designed to be a subsitute for kibble) so I broke them in half and gave one to each dog.  They ate them and continued to eat them daily until I ran out.  However my dogs go crazy for certain treats and will take a treat to a safe place and if a treat is really good the bigger dog will try and get the crumbs from the smaller dog.  WIth the Nature Variety the dogs merely took the treat and ate it on the spot.  They did not search out crumbs and did not seem to be overly excited for this treat as others I have given them in the past.<br /><br />Once again this was meant to subsitute kibble but in my opinion it would get expensive quickly so I used my sample bag for treats.,Neutral
"These treats are definitely different.  They are practically weightless, and have an odd texture like a cross between a packing peanut and paperboard, with a dusty exterior.  For some reason, I keep thinking of a rice cake or a meringue cookie when I look at these.  This is not necessarily bad, it is just different.<br /><br />My schnauzer was more hesitant with this treat, I think it was due largly to the texture, as she is used to hard, crunchy stuff.  She took one big chomp and it crumbled, ending up as a pile of small pieces at her feet that she ate carefully, one or two at a time, until it was finished.<br /><br />The smell of these treats is appealing to me, actually.  We have the chicken variety.  Unlike some meat treats that seem to radiate with a salty, bouillion-cube-like scent, these have a subtle chicken soup-like fragrance.<br /><br />The package contains 4 oz., which works out to about 16 treats.  This is pricey compared to, say, Milkbones, but as a human who is willing to spend more for quality ingredients, I wouldn't call the cost outrageous, especially since I don't give these to my dog daily.<br /><br />I prefer treats that work my dog's instincts to gnaw and chew, and if her teeth get a bit of cleaning at the same time then I'm happy.  The Raw Boost Bites don't give her any of that.  However, as an occasional treat to give her something interesting and different, these are a fairly good option.",Neutral
"I was pleased with the smell of the product, it smelled like actual food. I crumbled one piece and added warm water for my cats.

Cats can be notoriously picky.",Neutral
"I selected these to feed to my cats.  Because amazon didn't list the ingredients I had little to go on.  I was under the impression that these were 100% freeze dried ""raw"" chicken & turkey treats.  When the pkg. arrived I was disappointed to see that there are a heck of a lot of other ingredients.  Seems a high price to pay for a 4 ounce package of ""treats"" that don't have ingredients much different from top quality foods such as Wellness, Before Grain & others.  (Ingredient list is at the bottom of this review if you are looking for that info.)<br /><br />These ""bites"" are only bite sized for medium to large dogs.  For my cats they are WAY too big.  I had to break them into at least 4 - 6 pcs. in order for the cats to be able to eat them.  Even with my breaking them up, the cats still had to work at them.  Their freeze dried condition creates a very airy & light biscuit that is spongy, not crunchy.  It seemed to stick to the cats teeth making it very difficult for them to eat.<br /><br />The cats will ONLY eat these if they are very very hungry.  If I put down anything else, they will ignore the Boost Bites.  I also have barn cats that hunt pretty much everything so I feed them a cheap cat food.  I know they are getting tons of healthy nutrition in all the rodents, insects, birds, amphibians & grasses they can get their little paws on.  However they do enjoy their junk kibble.  Seeing how these Raw Boost Bites were an epic fail for the indoor cats, I tried it on the barn cats.  They were a tad more enthusiastic although they appreciated having the biscuits broken into bits too despite their bone crunching swallowing rodents whole abilities.  They struggled with the bites just as much as the indoor kitties.<br /><br />The bites seem more suitable for a dog.  Dogs aren't known to do a lot of chewing & are not usually as fussy as a cat.  I doubt a spongy dry biscuit would matter to an animal that tends to wolf things down within a gulp or two.<br /><br />Even though this is a product I'm not likely to buy in the future, I do not feel it deserves less than 3 stars when I think of all the disgusting garbage that is on store shelves for us to buy & poison our pets with.<br /><br />Ingredients as per the box:<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkin seeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flax seeds, Montomrillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols (note: probable GMO ingredient)with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin (note: this is being promoted as a prebiotic for fiber & digestive health.

At that price, it is a good buy; I personally would not pay more than that, nor will I probably order this brand again, only because it's just okay.  Amazon also sent me ground coffee, not beans.  If you are insistent on grinding your own beans, just check the shipment before you open it.  The three packages will come shrink wrapped, and I had mine open before I noticed that the packages were ground not beans. I'm sure that if I had complained to Amazon, they would have replaced the shipment, at their expense, because they do not take back food.  However, I will drink just about anything in the morning, and this coffee is passable, but nothing special. I also keep my coffee in the freezer until using it to preserve freshness and flavor.",Neutral
"I have ordered Kitchens of India products before (butter chicken and the rajma masala kidney bean curry) and have been pleased. Due to the good reviews for this product and my previous experiences with KoI, I didn't hesitate to purchase this.<br /><br />However, it's not really what I had expected. It's not as good as the butter chicken paste is, nor does it smell as good. This chicken curry paste is also VERY salty; I had to add more rice and vegetables to my bowl because I couldn't handle the salt. The flavor is strong, though not spicy, and I think that the butter chicken is much more balanced in terms of spices and flavor and I wish that I had purchased that instead.<br /><br />Still, this is easy and quick to prepare and while it doesn't taste great it's still decent, which warrants its 3 stars.",Neutral
"As I was cooking this I was instantly amazed at how good it smelled and started to really crave the taste.  However, as a few others have mentioned the Chicken curry paste had way too much of something that I couldn't determine.  Some have said salty and others cloves, but whatever it is it was just too overpowering and needs to be balanced out.  It wasn't too spicy at all.  I have 5 packets left so I will experiment.  Next time I will use two cups of water instead of one, hoping that will mellow out the saltiness, but I'm afraid that will dilute the rest of the flavor.  We will see.<br /><br />All in all the flavor was good, and preparation was easy so 3 stars.  If they can fix the overpowering flavor this would be 4.5-5 stars.<br /><br />I have noticed others saying the Butter Chicken is much more balanced and very good so I look forward to trying that out next since I bought that also.<br /><br />Also, I did have the Kashmiri Basmati Rice Pilaf with Vegetables & Nuts and that was great, and so simple to fix, takes 3 minutes.",Neutral
"I like many of the KOI products but this one is very heavy on something I can't figure out.  I've read the ingredients but still can't figure out what it is that just doesn't sit with me.  I DO NOT like it.  YOU however, may love it.  I am a HUGE fan of the Butter Chicken Curry.  I NEVER run out of it and use it with chicken, cauliflower, summer squash, oh you name it, I make it.  This one just doesn't do it for me.  Hence my three star.  Still a good product but the taste is somehow ""off"" from many of their other products.<br />I've rated it 3 stars since the texture, packaging, instructions, etc were all great and my overall success with their other products.",Neutral
"Normally I like salty foods, but this curry is WAY too salty. They need to tone down the salt some.<br /><br />Also, to make more of this sauce, just add some cream or milk to it. It'll thin down a little, but the flavors are so strong that it goes a long way!",Neutral
"I thought this curry is a ready made one that only needs the boiling.<br />However, it was a paste that needs watering, long boiling and most of all, chicken meat separately.<br /><br />It means: you cannot use this curry in the camping.

"The Sprout Master is made nicely and looks like it will last a long time.  I disagree with those that say it is flimsy.  It seems sturdy to me.  In terms of quality, it seems fine.  But in terms of growing sprouts from small seeds, there are 2 main problems, it seems:<br /><br />(1) It has pin-size holes for drainage, and small seeds get stuck in these and grow their roots through them. I am mostly making broccoli sprouts and alfalfa sprouts (small seeds). Probably the Sprout Master would work fine with sunflower seeds, nuts, beans, wheat, or other seeds that are at least as large as a mung bean. What happens with the small seeds, such as the broccoli sprouts, is that they grow their roots through the holes, and their roots make a thick mat underneath. So then it is very hard to remove the entire sprout. The roots break off, so then we have only the tops of the sprouts. I'm able to scrape the roots off of the backside and put them in the salads too, but it's just not as nice as the whole sprout unbroken. I don't have this problem with my other sprouting system, the Tompson & Morgan Seed Sprouter - Two-tiered (also available at Amazon). It works so much better because it has slots instead of pinholes.<br /><br />The broccoli sprouts don't make a mat of roots underneath the tray with the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter. They just make sprouts like you would see in the grocery store. I've also noticed that my sprouts grow much faster in the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter. I've done many comparisons, and it always is like this. I am not sure why. So, all things said, I wish that I hadn't bought the Sprout Master Triple Sprouter. I would have bought several more Tompson and Morgan Sprouters instead. They look very attractive and are a lot easier for me to deal with than the Sprout Master. I'm sure the Sprout Master is great for people that are using the larger seeds. Maybe I will start doing some larger seeds/nuts/beans too, but my main interest is with broccoli sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, radishes sprouts, etc., all of which have tiny seeds.<br /><br />(2) Clean-up:  The other thing about the Sprout Master, as others have noted, is that it's a bit difficult to clean small seeds out of the holes. You have to use the tip of a paperclip to poke stuff out sometimes.<br /><br />Once again the Tompson & Morgan is so much easier -- with their slots instead of pin-size holes, the seeds and other stuff fall right out during a quick wash and rinse. No paperclips and poking needed!<br /><br />And the Tompson & Morgan has gone through my dishwasher many times without harm. Sprout Master says don't put theirs in dishwasher, so I have not.<br /><br />***By the way, if anyone has some ideas for how I can make the Sprout Master work better with my little seeds, I would love to read your comments. Thanks! ***",Neutral
"The Sprout Master standard/larger trays in either single or stackable formats leave just a little to be desired in hardiness and instructions. They do the job of sprouting fairly well, but it may take a couple of tries to get exactly what you're looking for.<br /><br />Cons:<br />If you're only making leafy green sprouts for one or two, halve the recommended seed amounts in the chart provided. You'll get better airflow, too. A damp lightweight dish towel over the top works better than the provided tray for moisture and air circulation. The construction is a little flimsy, with the tray lid and catch pan of the exact same design. This means you can buy a single sprouter and then buy a second, but keep a towel underneath a single or stack, because the trays don't have much of a lip and even fairly small amounts of water can end up on your socks. The sprouting trays just feel...delicate. I've already cracked one washing it with a scrubber brush. The trays do not seal well enough that I would be willing to hike with them, but with the lids inverted into storage containers, nothing leaks in the fridge. Also, they're not dishwasher safe.<br /><br />The provided instructions leave just a little bit of doubt about whether the lid should be used during sprouting, under which conditions, or reserved for the crisper function. In our 72-degree home, it actually works better with the lid lightly overtop a lightweight dishtowel. They still stack that way. The trays also make it difficult to flush seed hulls from the sprouts, so instead of following their directions, I rinse my sprouts in a colander to get rid of the hulls before I put them back in the tray to green.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The instructions come with a guide for the amount of seed to use in a whole tray, half the tray with the divider, and with the two mini options as well as the amount of time various types of seeds should take to sprout and how many days of light they should have for greening up. It also includes the good advise of trying the seeds every day once they've grown out some, to find your perfect sweetness level. The trays seal well enough for the fridge, but not really for a backpack, as the mini is advertised to do. The dividers allow you to stagger ""crops"" and grow different types of sprouts. Because they're modular, you can buy a single, then decide you're into it and buy a triple and stack those, scale back down to one or two trays, and interchange the lids/catch pan between all the trays, presuming you buy all mini's or all standard/large sized trays. They more efficiently use counter space and fridge space than round designs, and they seal better in the fridge than the two sets of round trays I have. I use the divider even when growing the same seeds, because the partition increases the stability of the trays and makes them more resistant to cracking when a flat of eggs ends up on top of them in the fridge.<br /><br />Bottom line, they're nice for the money, versatility, and size considerations, but they're not the sturdiest and some clarity in the directions could really boost the nice set of sprouting guides that come with them.",Neutral

"I was very hopeful about this pie filling, since I love rhubarb and can't get it since moving to the South (not unless I pay through the nose).  However, I've only opened one of the two jars I bought, so far, and that jar WAS a generous amount for filling an 8 or 9-inch pie, but had what I consider to be much too thick a consistency (possibly as a result of all the sugar and other sweeteners necessary for the preserving process? I don't know).<br /><br />In addition, I may've simply gotten one 'bad' jar, but the flavor seemed 'off' -- almost on the edge of fermentation.  I 'cut' the jar of pie filling with a pound of fresh strawberries and turned it into a decent-ish 10-inch strawberry-rhubarb pie, but it still doesn't taste quite right to me, and there's still that slight hint of fermentation.  I can eat it, but I'm not in any hurry to finish it off.<br /><br />Perhaps my expectations were unreasonable, since I've never had a canned rhubarb pie filling before (not even home-canned), but always used fresh or home-frozen rhubarb, going easy on the sugar in the recipe to preserve that mouth-watering tartness.  Whenever I've had access to lots of rhubarb, I prefer it straight, no strawberries or blueberries or raspberries mixed in (though those are all good combinations).<br /><br />Honestly, I'm beginning to think it might be worthwhile to pay over $4 a pound for a bit of fresh rhubarb in the store, which I can cut with the much-cheaper strawberries to make a semi-rhubarb pie.  But that's just my taste, and as I said, I might've simply gotten a 'bad batch'.",Neutral

It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff.

The other ""soft white"" bulbs we bought work just fine.  The 30-watt bulbs are especially  bright and nice, but can actually put out too much light in a multibulb fixture and so might need to be mixed with 13 or 23 watt bulbs in that setting.  One other issue is that several of the Earthmate bulbs we received were broken and two were DOA but not broken.  The broken ones were clearly a case of poor packaging by Amazon (bulbs against the side of the box with no packing filler).  Amazon is great about refunding the appropriate amount so I have no worries about ordering Earthmate bulbs again.",Neutral

It's great to have agave in a portable format.  But is is difficult to open.  The directions say to pinch to open.  They are not so easy to pinch.  I have found if you bend the tube about 1 inch above the end then pinch the end it helps.  But the agave often gets on your fingers.,Neutral

"This is a fairly high quality confection.  The flavor is smooth, round, and fruity, almost raisin-y.  However, I am a dark chocolate lover, and dark chocolate lovers won't be seduced by refinement alone.<br /><br />So I consulted my spouse, a light/milk chocolate lover, and we both agree that while tasty, Newman's Own Organics dark lacks that subtle, almost spicy bitterness that brings out the complexity and assertive flavors of chocolate at varying cacao levels.  Now obviously 54% cacao isn't going to register on the palate like 70%, 75% or 90% cacao, but there can still be that ""snap"" to chocolate, which is often compared to notes in coffee or chili pepper, even at the lower percentages.  I can still, for example, perceive that note in many grocery store brand chocolate morsels, although the overall quality of those will not match the Newman's.  By comparison, the Newman's has a waxiness that reminds me of Dove or Cadbury's.<br /><br />I will say that this is probably a safe choice for company, where a little something sweet is desired that won't be too much for less-than-diehard fans of the dark stuff.  It's agreeable; just not distinctive enough to kill for, which is pretty severe criticism where chocolate is concerned!",Neutral
"We have a bit of a dispute over these bars in my house, so I can say with some authority that they are right for some people, not for others.

I personally found them lighter than I like in a dark chocolate and a little waxy.<br /><br />On the other hand, my daughter is a huge fan of dark chocolate, and gives this the thumbs up.  If you like your dark chocolate on the light side, you may like these too.<br /><br />At 2.25 ounces, these are about the total size of a retail candy bar, and a smidgen bigger than some.

"For those wanting dark chocolate, this simply is going to do the trick.  It's 54% cocoa solids and really quite sweet.  In terms of texture, it's a bit grainier than average.  It's not shiny, but kind of matte, and melts pretty reasonably.<br /><br />Each 2.25 oz (64g) bar has six large-ish squares, making portion control a little challenging.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, this definitely earns a solid three stars.  It's really not bad at all, like a very reasonable cocoa.  It's so sweet that it tastes a little like a really high end milk chocolate at first, with a good finish for a milk chocolate.  All in all, for a dark chocolate this is better than Dove (less ""smooth"" because it's grainier, but definitely a better finish), but can't hold a candle to a good high end dark chocolate like Lindt.<br /><br />In terms of organic chocolates, Green & Black makes a darker, smoother, better finishing chocolate, and the bars are bigger, too.",Neutral
"I am a HUGE fanatic of dark chocolate. I was excited to try Newman's organic dark chocolate. It's 54% cocoa, which should put it somewhere between not too sweet but not too bitter. It's a small size bar (2.25 oz), and 330 calories. Frankly, if it was larger, I'd feel much guiltier eating it!<br /><br />The chocolate is not very sweet, but not bitter. Actually, it really doesn't have much flavor at all, which was surprising. Compare this to a Dove Dark Chocolate, and the difference is very obvious. Dove is creamy with deep flavor. The Newman's is dry, almost chalky consistency without much flavor at all.<br /><br />Overall I was pretty disappointed in this chocolate. I love that it's organic - just wish it was tastier.",Neutral
"Maybe it is because this chocolate only contains 54 % cocoa (vs. let's say the 70 % Lindt) but I found the taste disappointing. This might be premium chocolate, and it might be organic and Rainforest Alliance-certified. But the flavor still is surprisingly bland and cheap - a tad too sweet and creamy, with a bit of a waxy texture in too thick a bar. This is just a run-of-the-mill dark chocolate and nothing to entice the palate with.",Neutral
"This 54% dark organic chocolate by Newman's Own is passable.  It is very dry, as are the higher percent dark chocolates, but not as flavorful as others, such as the Lindt or Godiva brands.  Although I enjoy many Newman products, I would not buy this chocolate, I enjoy either of the other brands much more.",Neutral
"I have always enjoyed Newman's Own products including the doggy treats but this chocolate didn't do it for me. Could be my aging taste buds but we all taste differently and this didn't excite me. Wasn't a bad taste just kinda bland, not exciting.",Neutral
"I am a lover of dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, this chocolate will disappoint true dark chocolate lovers.  Its waaaay too sweet!  Its not bad chocolate - its creamy, its rich, its got good cacao flavor, but they put too much sugar in it.  I prefer the very complex, slightly bitter, very dark (71% cacao) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JI0CK"">Dove Silky Smooth Dark Chocolate</a> instead.  Also, the Newman's chocolate is broken into six relatively large 1.5 x 1.25 inch squares - IMO just a little too large to just put one square in your mouth and allow it to melt away.  The Dove is broken into 1 x 1 inch squares - the perfect size to melt on your tongue.  Even the wrapper on the Dove is better as it is true foil and easily allows you to keep the remaining chocolate wrapped up tight.  The Newman's comes in gold paper meant to look like foil, but its only paper - it does not close well.  Overall, disappointed.",Neutral
"I've been a fan of Green & Black's Maya Gold, Organic Dark Chocolate with Orange & Spices, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 5) for many a year, so I was delighted to be offered Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar, 3.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12) for review. (There is currently no link availble to the Pack of 12 2.25 ounce bars) I've been anxiously waiting for my package to arrive, as I had discovered a few recipes on the Newman's Own site, one of which is for a Chocolate Angel Cake that sounded just delightful - and a great way to use up some of that chocolate! Imagine my surprise when that Pack of 12 turned out to be a single 2.25 ounce bar!<br /><br />As a result, I really cannot comment on this particular product other than to say it has a nice, smooth chocolate taste, though it is fairly low in cocoa solids. Any other properties that Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate might have as a candy or confection coating or baking ingredient will remain untested. Strictly as a chocolate bar, this is one I can take or leave. Green & Black's - long involved in the organic, sustainable rainforest movement - will remain my go-to dark chocolate bar.",Neutral
"First of all, I love dark chocolates tried a wide variety of them.<br /><br />For Dark chocolates to taste good - they typically need to made from the finest ingredients and manufacturing processes - else they are going to taste bitter and rough - leaving an unpleasant taste.<br /><br />I had high expectations about Newman's own Organics, but utterly disappointment.<br /><br />As you slip a square of the chocolate into your mouth - it feels smooth and good - ....  When you are done with 3/4 of them, thats when you realize that there is something kind of an aftertaste/not so smooth taste about this.  I do not get this feeling when I try a Lindt or dark chocolate truffles from Central Market/Whole foods.<br /><br />Overall - they are made of pure organic ingredients - but for whatever reasons - the cocao/manufacturing ... - the taste did not go over well with me.",Neutral
"Good taste, but more sweet than I expected. Also, the texture could have been a little creamier.  But overall, it hit the chocolate spot.",Neutral
"I've tried my fair share of different milk & dark chocolate brands. In the end, there are two simple categories for me in the affordable chocolate range:<br /><br />(1) Cheap, too much factory taste/feeling, not really worth the calories - Hershey's, etc.<br />(2) Memorable, usually more expensive but when you bite into it you agree it's worth it - Green & Black's, Lindt, etc.<br /><br />I'll eat from either category depending on my budget and level of chocolate neediness. My impression of this Newman's Dark Chocolate is it is priced as if it belonged to category #2, but tastes more like it belongs in category #1 (I suppose high end of category #1). Still, I would skip the Newman's and buy something from category #1 to get something that tastes like category #1 and save some money.",Neutral
"Unlike the other members of my family, I'm not a chocoholic.  I'm a take it or leave it consumer and in general, I go for the good stuff.  This sample bar was my introduction to the Newman's Own Organic Chocolate line, and in order to get a variety of opinions, I shared this taste with several co-workers.<br /><br />My immediate impression was that the bar had the nice, crisp snap of well-tempered chocolate, and also that it had a lovely texture, melting quickly and smoothly in my mouth.  The ""dark"" chocolate bar has a slightly smoky flavor, but only 54% cocoa, which is less than what many may be looking for in a dark bar.  (Newman's Own also has a super dark bar with 70% cocoa.)  All of us felt that this bar was sweeter than we would have ideally preferred, more akin to bittersweet chocolate than a true dark chocolate.  It was suggested, for that reason, that it might be a nice high-quality bar for baking--though as noted previously, it is not a standard baking bar size.<br /><br />The other thing that all of us noticed was a very subtle orange note to the flavor, to the point that we searched the ingredients for an explanation.  The ingredients of this organic bar are very simple and straightforward.  In fact, there are only five, none of which would explain this undertone.  And it wasn't a problem, overt, or unpleasant; it was simply commented upon.  Further perusing the Newman's Own offerings, I see they produce a dark chocolate orange bar, and I have to suppose there is some minor cross ""contamination"" of the flavors.  Mystery solved.<br /><br />A quick survey among my cohort revealed that there was only one of us who really cared that the product was organic.  Yeah, the rest of us are Philistines.  Based on the high price point and the low percentage of cocoa, even though we'd enjoyed the treat, none of us was inclined to purchase the product again.  Your mileage may vary.",Neutral
"I love dark chocolate so Newman's own naturallly appealed.  It has a clean taste, but lacks the depth and complexity tthat you expect from a premium dark chocolate.  I do like that it is not overly sweet -- know it would be great to bake with.",Neutral
"This was a surprisingly bland bar of chocolate.  It was not sweet, lacked the deep flavor of dark chocolate and had an almost waxy consistancy.  There was nothing special about it.  It was also too small to share with a friend.",Neutral
"I found this bar rather lacking in chocolate flavor.  At 54%, it might be possible that I am used to a higher cocoa content (60%+).  While some other reviewers have mentioned the mouthfeel as ""grainy"", I found it more chalky.  It melted well in the mouth without any grainy feel, but when chewed, became a rather gummy mass of chocolate.  It wasn't awful by any stretch of the imagination, but it was a little strange.  If you don't like dark chocolate, you would probably enjoy this bar--it seemed more like semi-sweet chocolate to me.  If you like dark chocolate, however, prepare for disappointment.",Neutral
"I got this chocolate for free on the Amazon Vine program, and for free chocolate, it was pretty good. But if I'd paid full price for it, I wouldn't have been happy. It was overly sweet and the texture was a bit grainy. I'll stick with Green & Black's when I want organic dark chocolate.",Neutral
"Like most health-conscious people, I appreciate the idea of organic food, and Paul Newman's Own is one of the most respected brands on the market. That's why I wanted to try this chocolate bar.<br /><br />I'm not a big ""chocoholic,"" but I do enjoy a taste of decadence on occasion, and this was one of those occasions.<br /><br />To make a long story short, I tried it and liked it, but it didn't taste nearly as good as Lady Godiva or even my old cheapie ""standby"" Hershey bar.<br /><br />Sure, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NHYQAS"">Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar, 2.25-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a> is  flavorful, but to my taste buds it seemed a little harsh... Oh, how do I describe it? I guess what I'm trying to say is that the texture wasn't creamy enough.<br /><br />In all fairness, I must confess that I often enjoy chocolate while drinking green tea; you know, a generous chunk of chocolate romancing my palate, followed by a sip of hot tea to mellow and enhance the taste sensation. Well, that proved to be what did it for me. Yes, I loooved it when savored in that manner<br /><br />I shared it with a friend who is more of a connoisseur than I am, and he loved it...straight from the stylish, golden wrapper.<br /><br />Another drawback for me is the expensive price. This 2.25-oz. size isn't available yet, but I found Newman's other same-size bars on Amazon for $26.88 per box of twelve. That works out to about $2.50 per candy bar (plus postage). Ouch!<br /><br />Needless to say, I would rather spend my hard-earned money another way. Sorry, Paul. I dearly love you and enjoyed many hours of quality movie time with you, but I'll stick to buying your salad dressings. Meanwhile, I'll get my chocolate kicks from my old friend, Mr. Hershey. Even Lady Godiva is out of my budget.<br /><br />With the small amount of chocolate I digest, it's not going to kill me. :-)<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 24, 2011<br />Author of ""Dream Reachers"" (with Chase Von) and other books",Neutral
"I love dark chocolate, but I found this bar too bland for my tastes.  It has one note of flavor and not very interesting.  Funny thing is, when I handed the remaining squares out, everyone who usually only liked milk chocolate loved this bar.  So if you like milk chocolate, but would like the benefits of dark chocolate, this may be the perfect compromise.  However, if you like the bracing complexity of dark chocolate, you may find yourself giving this chocolate away.<br /><br />I usually really like Newman products and like supporting their business, this is the first item I will not be repurchasing.<br /><br />NOTE: The bars are as tall as an iPhone and a little wider than one -- just a heads up if you think this is a large bar, it is not.  You will want to note the weight of the bars if using for a recipe.",Neutral
"This chocolate was a bit less sweet, more bitter, and harder than I usually enjoy.  For the price and the small bar size, I would prefer Dove dark chocolate.",Neutral
"Its hard to describe taste especially since I'm not a connoisseur of chocolate but of the brands that I have tasted, this one sits in the middle for me, not of the highest taste pleasure sensation but a great deal better then others I've tried.  I love the Newman's Own Brand and every product I've tried from this brand has been excellent.  I think this one might be best used for baking rather than eating straight out of the package.",Neutral
"This Newman's Own Organic Dark Chocolate is a good bar.  It has a rich dark chocolate taste, a good texture, and a nice mouth feel.  My only complaint is that it is a very small bar, so it's not outstanding enough to justify the cost.  There are better dark chocolates out there.",Neutral
"I will say upfront that there are very few dark chocolates that I like. I'm a fan of Ghiradelli, and Lindt, but not most of the others I've tried. The Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate was tasty, but the texture wasn't as smooth as some of the others I've tried. I'd say it's better than most (say, Hershey's Dark) but still needs tweaking to be as good as Lindt.",Neutral
"I didn't find anything remarkable about this candy. It's not more tasty, it isn't smoother, and it generally just isn't any better than other dark chocolates. I passed bites around to my office mates and everyone came back with the same reaction. Newman's brand is known for being a cut above everyone else; this isn't anything to write home about.<br /><br />I do appreciate the environmental aspect, though.",Neutral
"Not smooth enough or distinctive enough in flavor to compare to many high-end chocolates and with more chalkiness/waxiness than I expected, this simply was not a big enough step up from mass-market semi-sweet chocolate to be that interesting to me as a purchase in the future, even after getting this (single-bar, not pack of 12) free taste test from Amazon's Vine Reviewer program.  Not terrible, just underwhelming.",Neutral
"I must admit that I have never eaten an organic chocolate bar so I was excited to taste Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar.  Unfortunately, I found the taste to be bland.  The texture is nice and I liked that it didn't melt in my hand while I was eating it but this bar has the distinction of being the first chocolate bar to enter my house and not get completely eaten.  Newman's Own is a fantastic organization that donates generously to charity so I feel guilty saying this but I would not purchase or eat this chocolate bar on my own.",Neutral
"I love what Newman's is doing and I applaud their products.  I must confess that I am not a big lover of dark chocolate and prefer milk.  This particular bar tasted chalky, like maybe it had been available for a while (which, since it was free, may have been the case).  It also had an unpleasant after taste.  I am not sure if Newman's has  a milk chocolate bar, but if it does, I will get one to add the comparison to my review.",Neutral
"Some might argue that, just as there's no such thing as bad sex, there's no such thing as bad chocolate. (Even the worst of the latter I've ever consumed - in Leningrad, Russia in 1984 - was still edible. My history with the former we needn't discuss.)<br /><br />So, here we have NEWMAN'S OWN ORGANICS DARK CHOCOLATE (NOODC). Mind you, it doesn't contain such poncy embellishments such as almonds, macadamia nuts, cherries, pomegranate, mint chips, bacon shreds, rice krispies, orange peel, caramel filling, peanut butter, raisins, walnut pieces, toffee crunch, coconut, red pepper, coffee beans, cranberries, blueberries, white chocolate chunks, or the kitchen sink. It's just 100% chocolate, i.e. evaporated cane juice, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, and vanilla - all organic, of course. (It must be pointed out, however, that vanilla is used by chocolate makers to mask the flavor of imperfectly roasted cocoa beans. Hmm.)<br /><br />At 54% cocoa, NOODC isn't particularly elevated on that scale. Who in a chocolate company determines the what and why of an optimum concentration, I wonder? Probably the (cocoa) bean counters, I imagine.<br /><br />Because I have a taste disorder described more fully in my review of the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618861882"">Remembering Smell: A Memoir of Losing--and Discovering--the Primal Sense</a>, I can't judge the sweetness of this candy, but only the chocolate flavor and the ""mouth feel."" Both are pretty much average and acceptable. Is it better than one of my favorite brands, a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CH40HQ"">Cadbury Royal Dark Chocolate Bar, 3.5 oz, 24 count</a> bar? Uh ... no. But, it's infinitely better than that Commie chocolate eaten back in the nostalgic good old days of the Cold War! I mean, without any of the added embellishments mentioned above, a plain chocolate bar has to work overtime to stand out from the rest of that genre on the shelf.<br /><br />Actually, I was more interested in the subtleties of the label. Paul himself is pictured with Nell, his daughter by Joanne Woodward. Nell started the Organics Division of Newman's Own in 1993, and remained at its head when it chipped-off the old block in 2001. Dad still lent his support, though, before he died. I gather it's Nell`s leadership and participation that's inferred in the confectionary's subtitle, ""The Second Generation.""<br /><br />Again, according to the labeling, the cocoa has been certified by the ""Rainforest Alliance."" Perhaps I'm being cynical, but it makes me wonder how much Nell's company tips this outfit for the granting of its certification, however legitimate such a ritual blessing may be. Similarly, there's the notation ""Certified Organic by Oregon Tilth"" - whatever a ""Tilth"" is.<br /><br />Also, there's the usual CYA disclaimer: ""Manufactured on equipment that may process products containing peanuts, other nuts, milk powder, wheat soy, and egg."" The potential hazards for allergy sufferers aside, how might those possible contaminants affect the organic quality of NOODC if they themselves aren't organic? Inquiring minds want to know. (Perhaps the ""USDA Organic"" sticker carries implications here. I'll certainly sleep better at night knowing the guv'mint is involved.)<br /><br />And the fact that a 1 bar serving size contains only 5 mg of sodium means that my wife could chow down the whole thing - minus the single bite I was tossed - without fear of elevating her already borderline-high blood pressure. After all, dark chocolate is reportedly a health food.<br /><br />Would I buy NOODC on at the local chain supermarket without it being at a bargain, club price? Probably not. I've never been convinced that ""organic"" isn't mostly a marketing ploy to raise the sticker, and NOODC at full price doesn't give more satisfaction than a less expensive bar laden with assorted impurities, toxins, and carcinogens. And both go down equally well with a glass of cold, non-fat moo.",Neutral
"The flavor of this chocolate reminds me of Hershey's Special Dark from several years ago (the classic formula), only considerably milder. And it's not just me; the first reaction of those who I shared it with was, where's the flavor? The most charitable adjective I can think of is 'inoffensive', but that's not a good thing. Not something I would ever seek out again. Forgettable.",Neutral
"I can't give more than a 3 star average for this item, when considering the flavor and taste of this ""organic chocolate"" bar.<br /><br />Like some other Newman's Own food products that I've tasted, it doesn't offer any special quality, other than that the ingredients are virtually all ""organic"".  Unfortunately, our local, state and Federal requirements for ""organic"" foods, are severely flawed, and this product potentially  illustrates this problem quite well.<br /><br />The ingredients in these chocolate bars may meet most standards for organic foodstuffs, but there is an important element missing in the case of chocolate, that most people don't understand.<br /><br />I have read several articles recently about the high lead content of much of the chocolate that we consume, and for a period of time this problem was presumed to be that the cocoa beans themselves were (are) contaminated with lead, due to the leaded gasoline  in the engines of the farming equipment used in those countries that grow cocoa beans.<br /><br />However, some articles mention that lab analyses show that raw cocoa beans themselves have a relatively low amount of lead in them, compared to the final, processed chocolate products (and compared to other similar food products).  Some observant writers have then suggested that the high lead concentrations in cocoa products, are probably due to lead in the air near and over the drying beds, where the beans themselves are dried.  The reason for this contamination would be similar to the original theories, since there is likely high lead content in the air around these drying beds, for the prior reasoning (the lead in the gasoline used on the cocoa bean farms is emitted by tractor and other vehicle exhaust,  and then these contaminants attach themselves to the drying cocoa beans).<br /><br />At any rate, if the price of Newman's Own organic dark chocolate is as high as I suspect it is,  I would recommend buying a cheaper brand of chocolate bar (""organic"" or not), since there's no way to know whether Newman's Own chocolate has less (or more) lead in it, than other brands do.",Neutral
"Received only (1) - 2.5 oz dark chocolate bar,and we were expecting (12 bars) as stated in advertisement, so that was a disappointment to start with.  My husband and I shared the 2.5 oz bar, and we both felt that the quality was just average.  It was good, not too bitter, but not the best dark chocolate I've taste either. Based on the price, we would probably not purchase these in the future, as there are cheaper choices that are of the same quality, in my opinion.",Neutral
"With all the organic, single-origin, Fair Trade, 80% + dark chocolates available even in discount stores, I am not quite sure why Newman's Own brand wanted to get in the chocolate business. Anyway, this is a very light-weight entry into the fray, and at only 54% pure chocolate (in the Vine sample I received, anyway), a quite weak entry at that. It tasted okay, but definitely too sweet and lacking the earthy bitter-sweet taste of the more cacao bean-heavy chocolates available. Not much different than a decent Hershey dark chocolate bar, and likely much more expensive.",Neutral
"I was excited to try this chocolate as I'm such a fan of Newman's Own products in general.  It was good, but I found it a little disappointing.  It has a rich chocolate taste, but the texture is a bit too dry for just eating (which is what I intended to do with it).  It might work well for baking, but I haven't tried that yet...probably would work to chop up in pieces for cookies.",Neutral
"I really don't know what else to say except that it's moderate - not too bitter, not too sweet. The texture is not rich or exceptional in any way. It seems to be just a conglomeration of the ingredients listed on the package, so I would choose (or not) to get it based on whether you like that list.",Neutral
"Newman's Own is my favorite brand and I try all of their products.  However, this one is a failure.  The bar is bland and I guess 54% cocoa is not enough.  I am sure as chocolate bars go, this is nutritious, but frankly, it is hard to find a nutritious chocolate bar.  If you want nutrition it would be best to go and  get an apple.  When I want chocolate, nutrition is not even on my mind.  Decadence is.  This bar is not decadent enough.  Keep looking.",Neutral
"This bar reminds me of the semi-sweet chocolate used in baking.  The chocolate is neither instense on chocolate flavor nor very sweet, nor very smooth and creamy.<br /><br />My wife the dark chocolate aficionado in the house prefers a more instense dark chocolate - usually in the 70% + cocoa range.  Myself, the milk chocolate fan prefers a more smooth, sweet, and creamy chocolate.  In comparison, we bought a bar of Hershey's Extra Dark (60% cocoa) and it was both more intense and sweeter.  We both preferred it to the Newman's bar - surprising result for me considering I prefer milk to dark chocolate.<br /><br />I suppose those that prefer a semi-sweet, not overly creamy, medium intense chocolate this might be the ticket.  For us this  chocolate, though not bad per se, isn't what we are looking for when we want something to indulge in.",Neutral
"I'd suspect most people who try this will like it, at least enough to finish a bar. I prefer dark chocolate, typically with a higher % rating then this has but hey chocolate is chocolate so I wasn't going to turn down trying it. It reminded me far more of a bittersweet (think chocolate chip) then of my typical dark chocolate bars. It wasn't bad by any means but it didn't stand out as amazing either. It's obviously worlds above your typical ""candy isle"" bar but I wouldn't pick it out when compared to other organic dark chocolate options at a specialty market. For those interested in moving into dark chocolate for health benefits this might be a good transition bar into those with a higher % if you're used to milk chocolates.",Neutral
"This is an acceptable chocolate bar, but probably not worth what they're charging for it.  It's pretty mild on the dark chocolate scale and has a slightly odd texture--definitely not melt in your mouth.  I wound up using most of my trial bar to make hot chocolate, and it served that purpose quite well--better than eating it out of hand.",Neutral
"We love dark chocolate here so we waited eagerly to try the Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar.  It was something of a disappointment:  kind of waxy, too sweet, and the intense flavor of really good dark chocolate was missing.  You can really tell how good something is around here by how long it lasts -- and we still have about 1/3 of the bar left after about two weeks.  I'd skip the chocolate bar, but the Newman's Own ""oreo"" cookies are fabulous.",Neutral
"MMMM chocolate.  Can you ever actually give a bad review of chocolate?  In my opinion, no.  Even bad chocolate is still pretty good, because, well, it's chocolate.  However, this chocolate was exceptionally good.<br /><br />Consistent with the Newman branding, this product is organic and takes into consider the impact it's purchases make by using cocoa purchases certified by the Rainforest Alliance.<br /><br />This dark chocolate, made with real sugar, was slightly sweeter than I expected, but still had a rich depth to it.  Although it was 54% cocoa, it tasted like more.  Honestly, I've had better, but considering that this is both organic and sustainably produced some sacrifices have to be made.  This is a high fat and high calorie product, so be careful not to eat too much.  This probably comes partially from their use of whole milk but the percent of milk and chocolate liquor weren't specified so it's unclear what the technical classification of this product should be:  dark chocolate or milk chocolate.<br /><br />Overall a tasty treat that is great choice for those concerned about organic and sustainable products.  If  health or taste are your primary concern, you'll find better choices elsewhere.",Neutral
"I am a fan of the Newman's Own company, and its philanthropic mission. Some of their products are quite good, such as their spaghetti sauce and oreo-type cookies. This chocolate bar was not quite what I anticipated - sweeter and more buttery than I expect from a premium dark chocolate bar. The flavor does not linger on the palate and each square seems ""over"" far too soon.  Still, one thing I've learned from reading and writing reviews on Amazon is that there's an enthusiastic audience for just about anything, so I'm sure other folks will enjoy this more than I did.  Still, I think Newman's would do well to butch this bar up a bit, and let those with sweet tooths go for their milk chocolate instead.  Each to their own, I suppose.",Neutral
"Let me preface my review with this confession: I'm a chocoholic.  There's no such thing as ""too rich"" or ""too much chocolate"" or ""too decadent.""  I love me some chocolate goodness.  Milk chocolate, dark chocolate...not so much white chocolate and none of the fruit flavored chocolate.  My personal favorite is dark chocolate, but not that too dark chocolate that seems to be popular lately.  Now on with the review...<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of the Newman's Own brand and have a complete appreciation for organic products.  I had very high hopes for this chocolate bar.  Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed on several levels.  I found the chocolate to be drier than what my palate prefers, resulting in chocolate crumbles when I break off the pieces.  I don't like when chocolate (even the crumbles) goes to waste.  After all, any chocolate is good chocolate.<br /><br />I could tell, however, that the flavor of this chocolate was very pure.  It didn't have that ""additive"" flavor to it that some chocolate brands have.<br /><br />My last beef with Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate bar is that the squares are too big and don't break off easily.  I like bars that have smaller squares/rectangles to break off.  Because of the dry nature of the chocolate, there was never a clean break on the pieces.  It's a small, nitpicky thing, I know, but still something that matters to me when selecting a chocolate bar.<br /><br />And what made me ultimately give this chocolate only 3 stars was that after I broke off a few pieces and tucked the rest back in my purse, I COMPLETELY forgot I had any leftover.  This never happens to me.  I always break off a piece, and then save some for ""later.""  Later meaning about 3 minutes.  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar had me forgetting I even had any accessible chocolate for several DAYS until I happened to spot it in my purse again.  That should tell you something.",Neutral
"Ok so its chocolate that alone gets it two stars that being said this wasn't that great. I have tried many of the Newman line products and usually its pretty good/great. I still have more than half of it in my freezer that would not have happened if it wasnt so bland, with a strong after taste. Hershey dark chocolate has it beat by a mile. I will probably not be buying this one pity too I like what the company is trying to do but the taste eeehhh.",Neutral
"I feel like Darth Vader suggesting this, but really, Newman's Own Organics Chocolate Bar, come over to the dark side!  Reviewing a chocolate bar is not easy because so much depends upon the consumer.  I'm inclined to dark chocolates with high cocoa content and a sharp, bitter bite that mellows to a smooth richness in the mouth.  Alas, at 54%, this bar doesn't pack a dark punch.  Not to make light of it, but you'll find it a bit suspect -- as if it's fraternizing with the enemy (read: milk chocolate) -- if you're a true fan of dark.  If, on the other hand, you're equally at home with a milk chocolate, you will probably find more to like in this bar.  So consider your cocoa quotient, then proceed from there.",Neutral
"I'm not a huge chocolate eater.  I don't care much for overly rich chocolates, but I do enjoy semi-sweet dark chocolates (like Hershey's) and eat them often, even if not in huge quantities.  The Newman's dark chocolate wasn't quite as tasty to me.  As other reviewers have noted, it has a rather waxy texture to it that sort of threw me off.  I felt like I couldn't taste the flavor as well because it was too smooth and waxy.  Overall it was more bitter compared to the Hershey's.  And while that may suit some people, it wasn't quite my cup of tea.  I'll stick with my semi-sweets and let the real dark chocolate lovers have the Newman's.",Neutral
"As product lines go, Newman's is tough to beat. Organic, all natural, and money goes to charity. What's not to like?<br /><br />For this product, however, it's a swing and a foul ball. It's not a miss. The 50+% cacao stands out, with rich dark chocolate flavor similar to other bars. However, the mouthfeel and texture of this bar is all wrong. It's not creamy in the way chocolate should be, instead it leaves a thick coating on the inside of the mouth that is both unpleasant and ruins the flavor. I'm not certain what it is, but perhaps the type of fat or the fat content they used doesn't mesh with the chocolate bar. I found it rather unenjoyable to eat the entire thing.",Neutral
"Good things:<br />1 The thickness is a plus, it is nice to bite a thicker piece of chocolate.<br />2 It is all organic.<br /><br />Not so good things:<br />1 The initial aroma is a bit off putting somewhat like a cross between coffee and ashtray.<br />2 Takes a while to actually taste this product, it's overall weak on cocoa flavor but at least it doesn't taste like it smells!<br />3 Has a waxiness to it, even though there is no paraffin in it, not sure why.<br />4 My initial reaction to this supposedly dark chocolate was that it was way too sweet and not at all complex in flavor.<br />5 Anticlimactic chocolate lacking any particularly distinguishing notes.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Lindt chocolate, especially the very dark high cocoa percentage bars with their rich, wonderful, full spectrum of complex flavors and fruity notes. This product was just plain bland and nothing special. Three stars instead of two because I didn't hate it but I wouldn't buy it.",Neutral
"This wasnt really smooth or creamy at all. It had a distinct bitter taste, and was a little gritty like baker's chocolate. It was neither great, nor terrible. I wouldnt buy this as a snack, especially at the retail value.  For healthier eating, one should concentrate on main meals, not snacks and desserts. This is not one of the Newman line of ""better"" products, but most of them arent. Nothing beats the original salad dressing though, wow.",Neutral
"The chocolate taste was good (not great), and not too sweet, but the texture was lacking that silky smoothness (a bit chalky) of good dark chocolate. This is a mediocre effort all around. Not bad, but nothing I'd seek out for a second try.",Neutral
"This was nothing special. It reminded me a lot of other commercial chocolates I've tried.  I was disappointed that it was relatively waxy, and it didn't have enough of a dark chocolate flavor. It was a lot sweeter than what I expected. I would choose this over Hershey's or Ghiradelli, but there are a lot of other organic brands that provide a better chocolate experience (Dove Dark is even better than this).<br /><br />I did appreciate that it came wrapped in foiled paper.  It might make for a nice alternative to other commercial bars if you're looking for something wrapped up more like the old Hershey bar design. I can see someone removing the outside wrapper and putting a custom paper wrapper around the foil as a favor for a baby or wedding shower or maybe a special anniversary party.",Neutral
"I love chocolate in general and dark chocolate in particular.  But this chocolate bar is just ok.  It has kind of a waxy character to it and isn't what I'd call smooth.  Really kind of a slightly harsh cocoa flavor to it, which is probably due to it's high 54% cocoa content.<br /><br />It's certainly not bad.  I don't think I've ever met a chocolate bar that I didn't like.  But it's not especially good either.",Neutral
"I love the ""Newman's Own"" line of products, but this chocolate is not my favorite. I think if you like milk chocolate you will probably like this.  I like the 70% cacao version better but even it has a bit of a waxy taste and doesn't give you the mouth feel of truly great chocolate. While I like the 70% better, I set out the 54% next to the 70% Newman's Own and 2 people preferred the 54% - one of those 2 I consider a chocolate lover.  While I won't buy more of this, don't get me wrong. If this is sitting out next to some Hershey's, I'm going with this.<br /><br />I personally like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV7Q0"">Green & Black's Organic Chocolate Bar, 70% Cocoa, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 10)</a>.  MUCH better in my opinion.",Neutral
"Organic chocolate in my experience can be pretty hit-or-miss, especially if it's American-made. This is a perfect example -- while the Newman's folks probably liked it, it just doesn't do much for me. It's too sweet for my taste (though that may be more a factor of the 54% cacao content -- I'm used to more), and it has a weird solventy aftertaste to it that just ruins it for me.<br /><br />I wouldn't buy it. If you like sweet dark chocolate, though, you might.",Neutral
"I am a dark chocolate person and found that this particular chocolate was a little on the bitter side. Probably good for baking; however, I am not sure if I would buy it for regular consumption.",Neutral
"I found this chocolate to have a waxy mouth feel with a residual grit. Almost as if the chocolate was not conched long enough. The flavor was okay but the melting point seemed to be higher than usual for chocolate so it didn't melt so well on the tongue and, rather, needed to be chewed.<br /><br />It could be the higher cocoa content causing these texture issues but I was hoping for this bar to make my mouth zing with smooth chocolaty goodness and it didn't come close.<br /><br />Left me a bit disappointed.",Neutral
"If you like dark chocolate, this is certainly a contender.  And if you want organic, that narrows the field considerably.  For us, in an ideal world (with unlimited funds), organic would be nice.  But we happily settle for any good dark chocolate.  This wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it just did not stand out.<br /><br />What we didn't expect was such a great difference in the chocolate flavor compared to what we usually eat (I'll come to that in a moment).  Our favorite reasonably affordable dark chocolate is 60% cacao.  It's not organic, and doesn't have a star's name attached to it, but it's still considered a good brand.  At just 6% less than what we're used to (54%), both my wife and I were surprised that the chocolate taste didn't just jump out.<br /><br />What we compare to is the San Francisco-based Ghirarxxxxx Chocolate Company's 60% bittersweet chocolate.  While not organic, they at least advertise theirs as ""all natural.""  But we buy it for the taste.  It has a much more prominent dark chocolate flavor.  Newman's Own seemed rather bland to both of us - much more so than we would have expected for 54% vs. 60% cocoa.<br /><br />For some, the issue of cost may also be an issue.  Currently (at the time of this review) the 2.25 oz bar is not available on Amazon, but the 3.5 oz size is available, ranging from $1.33/oz to $2.06/oz, or ranging between roughly $21 - $33 per pound of Newman's Own.  One can go to WMart (they have frequent sales on this) or many grocery stores and pick up an 11.5 oz bag of Ghirarxxxxx Premium Baking Chips, 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate, the same thing as the fancy-packaged squares on the candy aisle at a far higher price, for between $2.50 per bag (on sale) to the upper $3 range per bag.  The key is to look for it in the baking aisle in bags, where the price is far lower than the candy-aisle version.  Even at $3.50/bag, that works out to about $4.90 per pound - a considerable difference from Newman's Own.  Even if Newman's was 1/4 the price shown elsewhere on Amazon for the 3.5 oz size, in order to make it price-competitive with the Ghirarxxxxx 60% dark, we'd go for the latter without hesitation - there's that much difference in taste.  My wife uses the Ghirarxxxxx frequently for baking, and if Newman's Own was competitive in price (and available as chips instead of squares), she'd still get the Ghirarxxxxx.<br /><br />Some reviews complained of a waxy texture with the Newman's Own.  We didn't really find that to be the case.  It melted nicely in our mouths (which we like to do before swallowing it in order to really enjoy the taste) and had what we both considered a nice consistency.  It was simply lacking a strong chocolate taste, though what was there was still decent.  I'd expect (and generally find it to be the case) that a dark chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa would have a fairly strong chocolate taste - much stronger than the namby-pamby taste of milk chocolate (which I used to love, and no longer even enjoy since our switch to dark).<br /><br />Some may say we're comparing apples and oranges (organic vs. non-organic).  Yes, and I realize that's not entirely fair.  But for us, though we buy a lot of organic foods, that isn't the major consideration when it comes to ""recreational"" chocolate (we're really addicted ;)  ).  Taste is the major factor, followed by affordability, and hands down our preferred brand comes out the winner.  I would not anticipate a follow up purchase of Newman's Own in the future, as a result of this sample.<br /><br />But if you've got the money, have to have organic, and want dark chocolate, you probably won't be disappointed with this product - it just isn't a stand-out.  I honestly expected more.",Neutral
"The body puff side feels rough, and is good for scouring pores in the chest and upper back areas.  My skin does feel smoother afterwards.  It's not very good at creating lather though.  Not sure if it's because the mesh is rougher, or the mesh is only exposed on one side.<br /><br />The back side is too rough for the skin -- I've been using it to sand down foot calluses.<br /><br />Might need to just use a regular body puff to apply soap, and use the Dove shower tool as a loofah and pumice stone.",Neutral
"This item isn't bad, but it has two big problems, it needs a replaceable pad, so one wouldn't have to buy a whole new one every so often, eliminates a lot of waste that way, as with many things. The second problem is that it needs a second rope on the other side, to allow for pulling back and forth (especially on the hard to reach places on the back, nearest the neck, I modified my unit to do this.

"If you're new to caviar or don't like overly fishy tastes, this is a fine pick. I prefer stronger taste and larger eggs. With better caviars, a little goes a long way. With this, you'll use larger portions - luckily, it's inexpensive enough to do so.",Neutral
"This caviar arrives, via Priority Mail from the USPS, not on ice but vacuum sealed in a set of four glass jars. I immediately put it into the fridge for a later date, which was today.<br /><br />The caviar is of the very small variety and did, despite not arriving chilled, maintain a mild crunch. The taste is over-salted, and a glance at the ingredients explains why. 620mg of sodium X 4 servings in one tiny jar of 3.5 oz. So 2480mg of sodium total. And the poor list of ingredients doesn't stop there. There is a stabilizer added, a preservative added, and three food colorings added. You may as well go to the grocery store and buy off the shelf rather than have this sent to you. I won't be buying it again. Please see my other review of a very fine salmon roe that arrives shipped overnight for free with ice packs. That same company also offers a delightful whitefish caviar that ships in the same manner and is very reasonable.",Neutral

"NIDO INSTANT DRY WHOLE MILK POWDER seemed the answer to the prayers of anyone with a too-small-for-their-needs-refrigerator-and-who-can't-afford-to-presently-purchase-a-new-refrigerator -- like me.  I've tried non-fat dry milk to save room in my refrigerator --but the taste is AWFUL!  I've tried to substitute sweetened condensed milk, (too sweet), and 1/2 and 1/2, (which needs refrigeration -- but not that much room in the refrigerator.  OK -- but no Vitamin D!  Nido Instant Dry Whole Milk Powder, though expensive, seemed just want I wanted -- and, though expensive, is not as expensive as buying a new refrigerator!<br /><br />The taste of NIDO is much better than non-fat dry milk.  And for most purposes, works quite well.  But somehow, when I try to use it with coffee -- and Splenda -- the sweetness of the Splenda is lessened.  I like sweet coffee -- but putting 3 or 4 times my usual amount of Splenda to achieve the sweetness I like in coffee could be dangerous.<br />(My doctor has already told me to cut down, as too much Splenda seems to be bad for the liver.) I suspect that the LECITHIN in NIDO is what gets in the way of the sweetness, as lecithin is NOT found in most liquid whole milks, (that I know of, anyway).  So my advice would be to use NIDO in anything that does not require too much sweetness, (sweentess from Splenda, and/or sucralose, at any rate.)  But if you don't require too much sweetness in your coffee, it's OK to use, I guess.  And it can always be used, if an emergency strikes and your refrigerator stops working.",Neutral
"The first few times I made hollandaise sauce from scratch, I failed about as often as I succeeded. You need to attend to this dish as you prepare it, or it curdles. I finally learned that lesson. When I made it right, boy did it add great taste to, for example, asparagus. On the other hand, it took lots of attention.<br /><br />So, as a compromise, I sometimes go to these packaged products.  Concord Foods makes a useable hollandaise sauce. The key advantage is ease of preparation. The cost? It's not as rich a taste as when I make my own. So, it's a tradeoff. But, in the end, this packaged product works well enough to justify my buying it from time to time.",Neutral

I love drinks in aluminum bottles, they just seem to carry more flavor over and contain their ""crispness"".

"I LOVE Merrick's products. I bought the Ranger Rib and was disappointed when I made my 6 month old German Shepherd mix spit out a small and very sharp shard he chewed off. It would have been easy for that piece to cut through his intestines if he were to swallow it. Hopefully he didn't swallow any pieces while I wasn't looking; I only had my eyes off him for maybe 8 minutes before he chewed through it.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this unless you watch your dog like a hawk while he/she chews it or if it's bought for a small dog that can't break off pieces easily -- there are other Merrick's bones that are much better; I bought ""The Sarge"" and my dog loves it!",Neutral
"I bought a box of these on another website. They were much larger than I expected, some pieces were much thinner than others. My dog got through most of the ranger rib within 30 minutes. She is still chewing on some of the pieces that have splintered off.<br /><br />The only worry I have is that the splintered pieces are just that. Thin, sharp, oddly shaped pieces. Even the main bulk of the bone after having split was very sharp looking. I would suggest to monitor your dog, especially if you have one that is known to not chew their food very well, or will get in a rush in the presence of another dog and swallow pieces before being well chewed. Swallowing these sharp pieces could be very dangerous and has me monitoring my dog very closely when she chews on these ranger ribs.<br /><br />I previously bought the Merrick GI bones. The bone is much thicker and does not splinter. One bone for her has lasted her (collie/hound mix) for more than a month and she has barely cracked the bone. Other breeds, her roommate the american bulldog/lab mix makes it look easier to crack the GI bone, but she practically devours the ranger rib very quickly.<br /><br />I would consider buying the ranger ribs only on a treat basis. MAYBE once a week if at that. They get eaten up way too fast. Although they are much cheaper than the GI bones, I don't believe they are worth buying if you want a bone that will last.",Neutral

"I thought, wow, bulk Lucky Country Red Licorice, sweet, but alas no, it is a mass produced Americanized version from Lucky Country's new US manufacturing plant.  The recipe is completely different from the Lucky Country Red Licorice (same brand, same name) that is Imported from Australia.  The original recipe has more real licorice despite being a red licorice, and is much softer.  The Made in US version is your typical chewy waxy candy licorice with barely a hint of licorice, just pure sweet.  Shame on Lucky Country for taking a high end sophisticated product and watering it down like every licorice sold in every drug store in the US.

"Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that ""oven roasted"" + ""honey"" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.",Neutral
"This is good tea, but I miss my Twinnings flavors.  The only problem I have with this tea is that it seems to upset my stomach after I drink a few.

Better it be Lifeboat or Scottish Breakfast, imo, for my tea parties. :-)<br /><br />Right now, my ideal blend would be a combination blend of Scottish Breakfast AND Lifeboat...

"The Good: PG Tips tastes a little like an earl grey and can be bought in bags or loose leaf. It tastes noticeably different than standard brands like Lipton. It can be found in smaller packages at most supermarkets in America. All PG Tips products seem to be reasonably priced.<br /><br />The Bad: I personally do not like the flavor. I am used to drinking loose leaf teas and am open to trying any kind of tea or herbal infusion, but until a friend said that this tastes a bit like earl grey to them I didn't think I would ever finish the box. Strangely, when I think about it that way it actually doesn't taste as bad, but it's still not the greatest.<br /><br />Other notes:<br />I've tried this on a recommendation from a friend. I bought the loose leaf variety because I normally prefer loose leaf teas. I can't imagine that the bagged variety would taste noticeably different to your average tea drinker, but I highly doubt that it has exactly the same flavor.<br /><br />If you're used to plain tea (black tea) brewed from bags (like lipton or bigalow) and you are looking for something different to try then go for it, but buy a small box just to try at your local supermarket.

Especially if it is a food product.<br /><br />EDIT 12/17/2011<br />Due to my concerns, I phoned Luck Chen and spoke at length about my apprehensions.  The noodles Luck Chen LLC produced were manufactured in China.  The MannaSoy product is manufactured in Israel.  My over critical mind assumed that because on Luck Chen's website (the LLC that is at the 'top' of the business structure, at least as product description reads ""Manufacturer: Luck Chen') then I felt all products under that name would be suspect of quality as well.  My concerns were fostered by lack of distinction on either Luck Chen's or Manna Soy's websites detailing the different countries of manufacture and lack of highlighting this applies solely to the noodle bowls; the Luck Chen representative said he hadn't considered how that may play out in a customer's mind and said he would work on clearing up that distinction on the websites.<br /><br />I now feel confident in ordering some of the MannaSoy product and giving it a spin in my wok.

"Emerald Almonds with a chocolate-powder coating are an interesting concept.  It offers the opportunity to enjoy both healthy almonds as well as the flavour of dark chocolate at the same time.

"These are chocolate dusted, not 'coated', hence they are a bit drier than I would have liked. I have noticed that other people like these, most particularly my Filipino relatives. The taste is good - it's the consistency of the almond that didn't appeal to me. They are a bit tougher than what I am used to, therefore they are a bit hard to snack on. However, if you are intent on loosing weight this would appear to be the combination for you.

"Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds are most definitely a quality, worthwhile snack item for the almond lover. My main concern with this product is that these do not have much, if any, ""cocoa"" or ""dark chocolate"" flavor like they advertise. It's just a very light dusting of powder on each almond, and the taste really doesn't stand out. The almonds themselves are fine, and I've never had any real issues with any of Emerald's line of canned nuts. So if you're looking for a relatively healthy snack item, these would satisfy your cravings. Just don't expect a burst of chocolate flavor.",Neutral
I think Emerald is a better brand than Planter and Diamond. They keep the nuts very fresh and have many different flavors. I buy Emrald's dry roasted almonds regularly. And no one seems to tire of it. I also buy the flavored ones when we have guests and always receive accolades.<br /><br />But the cocoa roast almonds are still left in the jar after 3 weeks.

One didn't like them at all, but the others gave them either 4 or 5 stars--particularly enjoying the smallness, crispness and lack of sweetness.  I probably wouldn't get them again for myself, but defnitely could put a bowl out for guests, as a casual alternative to greasier and sweeter snack foods.",Neutral

Both almonds and dark chocolate are healthy ingredients and I would love to give this product 5 stars.<br /><br />But, there are also not so good ingredients in the product: artificial flavors and the artificial sweeteners, acesulfame potassium and sucralose.

"Emerald Dark Chocolate Almonds has just enough dark cocoa to soothe your cravings.  Roasted into the almonds, the cocoa power is not the messy treat that other brands offer.

Eat them simply because they're good, although they are a good source of Vitamin E and potassium.<br /><br />On the down side, these almonds are sweetened with sucrolose (Splenda), so if you're staying away from artificial sweeteners, avoid these almonds.

"I was particularly excited to try Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds when they arrived in the mail today as I love chocolate and I love nuts.<br /><br />Five individuals ranging in age from 2 to 50 tried these together and shared feedback. A few common threads emerged.<br /><br />1. Chocolate doesn't come off on your hands: Very convenient as there is almost no residue left on hands even after holding a handful of nuts for a minute.<br /><br />2. Very subtle chocolate flavor: For some this is a plus and for some this is a negative. You know the chocolate is there, but in my opinion it just leave you wanting more chocolate. I couldn't eat more than 10 or so for that reason. They were just plain frustrating. This was the consensus of 4 out of the 5 taste testers. The fifth loved them and plans on finishing off my canister and probably ordering more. They are definitely not milk chocolately, but have barely discernible, subtle dark chocolate undertones.<br /><br />3. Dry: We all needed to drink water immediately after tasting the nuts as they dried our mouths out, much more than normal salted or roasted almost or any other nut for that matter. Three of us described them as tasting ""burnt"" or ""too roasted"".<br /><br />4. We keep eating them: Even though I'm not crazy about these nuts -  in fact only one of us was - we keep coming back for more about every hour or so. I get frustrated every time I do, either wanting a chocolate bar or just some plain old chocolate. Perhaps this is a good trait in a snack, that you can't keep eating them ad nauseum.<br /><br />Other observations<br />The 11 oz ergonomically comfortable container is about 8 inches tall and fits perfectly in your hand or in the cup holder of the car. The lid is screw-on rather than flip-top. The package contains 11 servings of 150 calories apiece (120 calories from fat), 13 grams of fat, six grams of carbs, and 6 grams of protein. Very much the same as other nut products.<br /><br />The conclusion? If you aren't sure already that you love these nuts, buying a four-pack might be too much for you. But if you love them, you love them, as evidenced by our one taste tester and many of the other reviews. I'd recommend trying a smaller volume before ordering in bulk here.",Neutral
"I'm a person that really loves nuts, especially flavored nuts.  When I go the local farmer's market, I always look for the nut stand so I can buy some kind of cinnamon, honey, jalape&ntilde;o, or whatever-flavor strikes me.<br /><br />When I was offered a chance to try the cocoa almonds, I was pretty thrilled.<br /><br />These nuts just ""okay"".  They're not spectacular.  As another reviewer noted, they aren't very chocolately.  If you have a chocolate craving, this will just make it worse.  They're also very dry (as are most almonds) and you'll need something to wash down every handful.<br /><br />The almonds are high-quality, and it's a good cocoa taste, but don't expect to be blown away by this.  It just won't happen.<br /><br />The container is probably what impressed me the most.  It's sturdy, resuable, handy to hold, and the screw-top keeps the product fresh.<br /><br />If you're looking for almonds with a subtle cocoa (not milk chocolate) hint then this is for you.

"I really thought I would love these.  I like all kinds of nuts, roasted and otherwise.  I like all kinds of chocolate, really like dark chocolate.  Heck, I even love mocha roast coffees and dark beers described as nutty. But I don't love this product.  Maybe it's just me.  I understand it's not cocoa in the sense of a creamy coating, but rather it's a dry dusting that is not unhealthy.  I understand it's dark cocoa.  But I didn't like the taste.  I will end up mixing these in with other trail mixtures.<br /><br />If you havn't tried them, I'd maybe find a way to get a nibble somewhere before buying a four pack.  You might love em.  Or like me, you might be surprised.",Neutral
"but I guess I don't really love them together. The chocolate is not sweet at all (they also have no other flavor to them), which means I can only eat about three before I feel like their getting bitter.  It may be that their just too dark for me and they will not be too strong for someone else.  they would probably be good in a trail mix of some kind to give your taste buds some flavor variety.",Neutral

I like the taste of natural almonds and found Emerald Cocoa Roasted Almonds to be a bit too much for me. I can always tell a good nut by the ""can I stop eating"" factor. I found it very easy to get away from these almonds and didn't find myself craving them at all like I do most seeds/nuts.<br /><br />I'd be willing to try another flavor, but for the time being its natural (no salt) for me.",Neutral
"I was waiting with higer expectations to this product, just before yesterday when it was delievered.<br />I expected the taste would be sweet and rich-cocoa since they are saying it is cocoa roasting almonds, but it's just slightly rosted with cocoa. once I taste it, I was pretty disappointed.<br />it's just not only real almonds's taste, but also not strong cocoa's taste. also, they are very dry. that's why it's easy to be cracked.<br />anyway, if I knew it's just weak taste of cocoa, i would just bought the raw ones for rich and fresh taste.",Neutral
"The nuts come in a handy package, and they smell very good. However, the taste is dry and bitter, not the kind of ""cocoa"" flavor you might expect if you're a fan of most dark chocolate products.

"Emerald's Cocoa Roasted Almonds (Dark Chocolate flavor) offer an interesting take on the age-old combination of chocolate and nuts. Instead of being coated in a ""skin"" of chocolate, the nuts are roasted in what appears to be cocoa powder; the result is a mixed bag.<br /><br />Although there's a definite hint of chocolate flavor, it's not very strong, and if you're looking for a chocolate-y treat, you'll probably be disappointed. However, if what you want are almonds with a twist, then you'll likely be delighted with Emerald's latest  product.",Neutral

"I popped several of these into my mouth without reading the ingredients (which I thought were pretty well covered in the product description). They tasted good for a brief instant and got progressively worse as I chewed. For one thing, they're quite dry (if this review for some reason piques your desire to whip out your credit card, make sure you have mass quantities of liquid on hand--you'll need it). These are, in fact, the driest almonds I've ever eaten.<br />The Dutch-processed cocoa used tasted anemic (I grew up on Hershey's). Insult compounded injury in the form of a bizarre aftertaste. This prompted me to actually read the label...imagine my surprise at discovering that the nuts are sweetened by none other than Sucralose.<br />I don't like Sucralose. The feeling is apparently mutual: it gives me a headache.<br />2 oz. of Cocoa Roast Almonds (Emerald having eschewed the two-word modifier) provides 150 calories, 120 of which, despite their dryness, are from fat. It seems to me that those watching their weight and/or sugar intake could probably find a more enjoyable source of 150 calories.",Neutral
"Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds is a fine, alternative way to indulge ones chocolate/nut cravings without all of the chocolate calories.<br /><br />Rather than dipping almonds into chocolate syrup or batter, the nuts are roasted with a lightly coated layer of chocolate powder. One ounce is only 150 calories, with only one gram of saturated fats, making this a healthy alternative to standard chocolate treats.<br /><br />The taste? Pleasant enough, but lacking the inherent richness one commonly associates with the tasty combo of chocolate and nuts, replaced in its stead by the fairly dry, pasty sensation of dipping whole nuts into instant hot chocolate mix. This means that Emerald's Cocoa Roast Almonds is a fairly satisfying nut snack, even if it is rather lacking as a chocolate one.<br /><br />All in all, not bad, but best washed down with a cold, or hot, glass of milk.",Neutral
These would have been a lot better if they hadn't coated them in splenda. Bleh I wish that it was clearly printed on the front of this product that it contained sucralose and I would have chosen another flavor. That's something I feel should be clearly printed on the front of the label and not hidden in the ingredients list on the back. I do not eat sucralose because it causes my eczema to flair and I feel that if it's doing that then it must be causing some sort if harm in my body. I do NOT like not having it clearly stated that this product contains it.<br /><br />****update**** 10/26/2011<br />I changed my stars (from 1-3) even though I still think the sucralose (splenda) should be labeled better but because the person I gave them to really enjoys them. So if you able and willing to eat sucralose that this product maybe worth a try for you.,Neutral
"When I got my hands on these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds, I thought that the concept was actually pretty good.  I had my doubts, though.  When I opened the container, there was a very, very light chocolate smell that was overwhelmed by the natural smell of the almonds.<br /><br />After trying a few of the almonds, I tasted only a slight hint of chocolate (especially in the aftertaste).  I tasted no salt whatsoever.  The almonds themselves had a rather bland taste to them.  Perhaps it was the mixing of the two flavors that negated both of them.  Mind you, there was nothing terrible about the taste.  It was just bland.<br /><br />The crunch factor was about the only redeeming quality of these almonds.  Dry roasting provided a very nice loud crunch.  The dark chocolate ""dust"" wasn't messy, but a tiny tad of it did get on my fingers.  It was easily washed off, however, and this really isn't a major concern for me.<br /><br />What has me fence-sitting, though, is the fact that when my wife came home later in the evening, she tried the almonds and fell in love with them.  I was fully prepared to give a two-star rating to these almonds until she gave them such glowing approval.  In the end, I guess that it all boils down to personal taste.  If you like very light and (at least to me) very bland chocolate and nutty tastes mixed together, get yourself some of these Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds.  However, if you're taste buds lean heavier towards the chocolate end of the spectrum, stick with Goobers.",Neutral
"There's a lot to love about these nuts.<br />- Great taste.  Subtle, not overpowering chocolate flavor.<br />- Convenient package (bounces if it hits the floor, easy to pour, etc.)<br />- No sticky mess on your hands.  Not gonna melt on a hike.<br /><br />But alas, I don't plan on getting these again.  Here's why:<br />- ""Artificial flavors.""  Who wants that stuff?<br />- Acesulfame Potassium and sucralose.  Ugh :(<br /><br />You know, give me nuts with a few more calories but all-natural, and I'll be a happier snacker.  I bet you would be, too.",Neutral
"""Chocolate without guilt"" is a good idea, and coating nuts with sweetened cocoa powder (the sweetener is a mixture of a sugar alcohol -- sucralose -- and acesulfame) not a bad one at all. But the result is disappointing.<br /><br />The chocolate and almond tastes tend to hide each other rather than to complement each other. I was expecting an intense chocolate+almond taste, but didn't get it. There wasn't much of either.<br /><br />I tried sucking off the cocoa, but the naked almond was not particularly satisfying. A ""good"" almond, but not a great one.<br /><br />Almonds have a relatively delicate taste that (for me) is best appreciated without any enhancement. (I never cared for Jordan almonds.) A cocoa coating would probably work better with a stronger-flavored nut.",Neutral
"Almonds in this product are quite good.  The coating is well-bonded, and they are neat to eat.  Having the lid measure out a 1.5 ounce serving is a nice touch, but not a big deal.  The flavor definitely reminds me more of cocoa than of chocolate, and isn't terribly strong.  Definitely do not buy these thinking you are getting chocolate-covered nuts of some sort!  But they are a decently healthy snack, and much healthier than eating said chocolate-covered nuts.  I'd rate them higher if the price was more economical, but as it is they are too pricey for a casual snack, but not ""snazzy"" enough for something ornate and formal.  For this price, I'd rather get cashews!",Neutral
"I'm not paranoid about artificial sweetners, but I am unable to eat Sucralose (AKA Splenda). One soda with the stuff in it gives me a migraine. Being an idiot, I've tested this with several different Splenda containing products & found that the sweetner is the problem. SO if you are like me, avoid this product.<br /><br />That said, I did pop a few in my mouth before reading the label & they are yummy. I am only a sometimes fan of almonds, but I love dark chocolate.<br /><br />My partner (who doesn't have a Splenda hating noggin & who loves dark chocolate even more than me) was quite fond of these little nuggets. 6g protein (and 13g fat) in a 1/4 cup...not bad. Though I do wonder what they'd taste like if the Sucralose were left out...",Neutral
"With almonds and chocolate, what's not to love? Well... these aren't dipped in chocolate almonds, these are baked in chocolate flavor. The baked in chocolate flavor provides no mess but the baked in flavor kind of gives it a burnt flavor to me. These almonds were just alright, I was a little disappointed in them. They also get their lightly sweet flavor from Sucralose which I think provides a fake kind of sweetness flavor. Overall, if you really love almonds and are looking for a healthy snack then you might like these but if you are looking for a chocolate snack then you'll be disappointed with these.",Neutral
I have had a number of other emerald products and all have been good. These just didn't taste right to me. So I offered them to a number of coworkers and they all agreed.<br />Most say they needed salt. A few said they needed some sugar. About three people liked them they way they were. About two thirds said they would not purchase them. I myself wouldn't buy them if offered a choice.<br />The two flavors just don't seem to mix well.,Neutral
"Anything that claims to be ""dark chocolate"" flavored immediately has my attention, as I'm a true chocoholic with a preference for the intense bittersweet flavor of a good dark chocolate.  Unfortunately, these cocoa-dipped almonds don't deliver on the promise of their name, although they are indeed a good, nutritious (but high fat) snack with a hint of sweetness and chocolate flavor.  Not surprisingly, the predominant flavor is almond; the nutty, skin-on taste overwhelms the chocolate dusting.  Nut lovers will likely appreciate the twist on an old favorite since the cocoa does indeed bring out the almond flavor.  The almonds are crunchy and roasted to perfection, with few or no overdone brown interiors.<br /><br />Diabetics and others who watch their sugar intake will be pleased to learn that this snack contains only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving because of the addition of sucralose, an artificial sweeteners better known commercially as Splenda.  Dieters, however, will want to be careful with the 13 grams of fat in that same size serving.<br /><br />In general, I like Emerald nut products, but this one disappointed me, mostly because I found the chocolate flavor lacking and because I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  When I crave nuts, I go right for this canister, but when I crave chocolate, I look for something else.<br /><br />Also from the same company and recommended by me:  Emerald Nuts Glazed Pecans, Pecan Pie, 5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12), <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ELWG3E"">Emerald Nuts Dry Roasted Peanut, Honey Roasted Peanut & Cocktail Peanut, 4.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 18)</a>, Emerald Nuts Glazed Walnuts, Original, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 12)",Neutral

"I liked these (although not as much as the chocolate chip) and the ingredients and vitamins seemed good (even though a tad too sweet) but..everytime I'd eat one I'd become ill.  I couldn't figure out why until I researched the ingredients.<br /><br />I'm moderately to severely allergic to MSG and it gets worse as I get older.  I kept reading the ingredients wondering if there was something in these affecting me and after a little internet research found that the ""Maltodextrin, Brown Rice Syrup, Natural Flavorings, Whey Protein Isolate and possibly a few other ingredients contain varying amounts of MSG.  The combination of all these was enough to make me sick.  I'll have to stick to snacks without such a high combination as other snacks haven't had such an effect on me.

and they aren't softening in the milk. you will need strong healthy teeth to chomp on them.  the cereal itself sops up a lot of milk & it expands quite a bit (so don't pour too big a bowl like i did. now i'm trying to stuff it all down). There is the occasional really hard nugget of grain mixed in. when i come across one it tends to jam into my cavity & is a little uncomfortable.  but for the most part the cereal is soft & easily chewed just like mashed up wheaties.<br /><br />  Honestly this tasted strange to me on the first couple bites but as i sit here enjoying my first bowl i'm getting used to it.  before i bit in i thought i detected a weird smell.  i think it's just the way one or more of the grains smells & i wasn't familiar with the scent of that particular grain. or maybe cause they are sprouted they smell different. OR perhaps the addition of cinnamon did it. if so it's the only time i smelled something w/cinnamon that didn't smell better w/the cinnamon added.<br /><br />  in summary i think this is a pretty good cereal for those into super healthy foods.  The average person looking to add some whole grains could do a lot better in the taste & texture departments. If you are interested in sprouted grains specifically then i can't say for sure as this is the only sprouted grain cereal i've ever had.  I think i may try another box but next time i'll get the one with almond slivers. perhaps those flavors will be more complementary. and i'll bet the almonds are softer than the raisins.......i'll be sure to review it once i try it!,Neutral
"My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.

One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.

"Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip.

I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.",Neutral
Ok so my cat loves the flavor will eat them like they are going out of style.

Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.,Neutral
My wife's cats love all the temptation treats.  They will eat these becuase they are gluttons but it is obvious they are not that keen to the taste or the way it makes them feel.<br /><br />I noticed no difference with hairballs using these treats.  If you need something for the hairballs get the brown barley or malt paste.  That stuff works real good and some cats actually like the taste.,Neutral
"Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running.

I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.",Neutral

I'd have to agree with a lot of the reviews on here that the syrup wasn't really worth the price, but to each their own. Restating something I readin another review, the syrup isn't from one particular farm, it seemed like a blend from different farms from different states.

"Like most other reviewers have stated, the ginger flavor overpowers the lemon flavor.  Ginger can be ideal for certain types of ailments, so this drink would be ideal for that.  But I found it lacking in taste to be an everyday type of tea.  It does mix easily though, which is a nice trait.",Neutral
Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix can be enjoyed cold or hot. I Chose to drink it as a hot beverage as tea. I usually drink Ginger tea to sooth an upset stomach or to clear up congestion. I had s sore throat and this seem to h my throat. I didn't much like the taste. This drink seem to leave somewhat of an after taste andit als had somewhat of a bitter taste to it. All in all it was an OK drink.,Neutral
"There really isn't anything special or outstanding about this beverage. It's just like most of the instant ginger drinks out there in the market place. Though i would say, a sachet of this is good for 2-3 tea cups. It is quite strong and will have a bitter taste if you pour the entire sachet into just one tea cup. Apart from that, it just like any other instant ginger drink. I must also say, the ginger taste is by far dominant, you hardly notice the lemon at all.",Neutral
"The ginger taste in this is overpowering. I made it with one cup of water and thought it was undrinkable. I doubled the amount of hot water and still couldn't stomach it. I tripled the amount of water and thought it was still awful.<br /><br />But, my wife thought it was okay and my daughter, who is just back from college, loved it. My daughter loved it full strength, half strength and a third strength and said she's actually going to buy it.<br /><br />So, I'm torn here in rating this. Had I not consulted my family, I'd blast this with one star. My wife was almost neutral, but my daughter thinks this is the cat's meow. So in all fairness, though I don't like it, three stars.",Neutral
"This stuff is WEIRD.  It's like hot lemon tea, with a spicy KICK.  You take a sip, and at first it's sort of bitter-sweet and you think ""MMmm maybe I like this?"" then you swallow and it's like YOW - your throat and tongue burn from the ginger.  You think ""Ugh what is THAT?"" and you put your mug down.  But then, you are drawn to that - that ZING again - like a moth to a flame.  You pick it up - get that weird sweet taste, swallow, then BAM, again with the sting of ginger.<br />I kind of like it, but I kind of don't.  Do I recommend this?  I have no idea!",Neutral
"this was ok but I didn't really care for it personnally. It dissolved easily and had a good mild lemon flavor. I didn't really taste the ginger. It isn't something I would pay money for to have again, maybe if the lemon flavor was stronger but it's more of a hint of lemon taste and I do love lemon flavor. Others may like it more, everyone has their own tastes, this is just how it seemed for me and I am a daily hot tea drinker, all flavors. I thought this would taste more like that but in a tea bag you can steep it for more flavor. This has quite a bit in each little package for one serving so it would be very expensive to use more and like all crystals, they aren't evenly blended in the package so you won't get the same flavor everytime if you need to add extra.",Neutral
"The gold kili mixed easily, no clumps in my cup of hot liquid. The smell was very nice, although I could really only pick up the ginger.<br /><br />Sipping, the ginger hit me first. In fact, the beverage tasted of ginger and sweet. There didn't seem to be a balance between ginger and lemon. Eventually I picked up a very odd lemon taste, sort of like when I sprayed lemon pledge and accidentally inhaled, it doesn't so much taste lemony as vaguely lemon chemical. Heavy ginger, very sweet, not for me.<br /><br />I think I'd rather squeeze my own lemon, toss in a slice of ginger and a bit of honey in a cup of hot water. Between the way to sweet and the fake chemical lemon aftertaste, this is not my cup of beverage.",Neutral
"I agree with this product's description as it having a unique"" flavor. While the flavor is not unpleasant it has a certain Asian quality to it. I am a traditional tea drinker, but tried this one out to see what it was like. I enjoy lemon and ginger, as well as honey so I figured this would make for an interest brew. It does have a bite to it due to the ginger- a slight heat to the back of the throat. On the whole the aroma was divine and made my allergy nose open up a bit and feel great. The overall flavor is that of an herbal healing broth, not so much a relaxation and read-a-book cup of warmth. I would recommend this for those looking for herbal remedies that taste like the ingredients they are made with. This unique flavor is full of ginger and a touch of honey.",Neutral
"The ginger and lemon pouch is good for making a cup about 20oz size.<br />Use boiling hot water, not cold water, it may not dissolve as quickly.<br />The ginger taste is strong and natural.  For this part of the flavor test, it doesn't seem to be artificially engineered ginger taste.<br />But the lemon flavor in the mix is a different story.<br />It tastes a bit funny because it has a bitter lemony aftertaste.<br /><br />I've had several different kind of ginger teas, some very strong, some only as a flavor.<br />This one comes in a middle mix--not as strong, and not as a hint of flavor only.<br />Yet, some really natural strong ginger beverages, after mixing with hot water and drinking it, you could be sweating very soon and feeling hot and burning.<br />This tea doesn't give that fresh burning or warm sensation from the gut.<br />It also doesn't taste as spicy as I had hoped, though it should be rated as 6-7 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the strongest if you cooked with fresh ginger by yourself.<br />Overall, it's not a bad ginger-lemon mix though I would hope they mix some honey flavor inside as well.<br /><br />I give it only 3 stars because Amazon shipped this one single pouch in a box the size of a Epson printer!!!!  Yes, a size of a box that is 14""x 18"" x 8"".<br />This could have been shipped in an envelop but they wanted to give me a surprise.<br />I hope they fire the guy who shipped that box!",Neutral
"I am a big tea drinker and LOVE Ginger tea b/c it works great for stomach sickness, queasiness, and overall digestive health.  I like the flavor of this b/c it's got a strong lemon flavor and it also smells wonderful, however, the b/c it's in powder form it leaves a little bit of a weird after taste and kind of coating in your mouth.  Overall, I would choose ginger lemon tea over this b/c tea has a cleaner texture and doesn't leave a coating in your mouth like this powder version.",Neutral
"This is instant drink with lots of ginger flavor it it.  In some ways it is almost like drinking ginger tea without the tea bag. Drink has very dark color and in my cuup it almost looked like coffee.  Taste is very interesting.  If you like ginger already, you will enjoy strong peppery ginger taste.  What is unusual about this drink is that it has a very sweet aftertaste.  For me personally, it was too sweet.  I could not find a list of ingredients to confirm if this drink uses any artificial sweateners and that is why I doubt I would try drinking it again.  I just was not sure what is the calorie intake for this beverage.<br /><br />If calories are of no concern to you, than this is definitely a fine drink to try.  All you do is pour hot water and it's done.",Neutral
"You have to love ginger to like this product. It's not a ginger-flavored drink, it's a ginger drink.<br /><br />I admit, i only like ginger, i don't love it. I found the flavor to be too strong, and too bitter. I had to add a fair amount of sugar to make it drinkable. Never once did i notice any lemon flavor.<br /><br />As with most drinks, it's going to be up to each individual to decide if they like it. Ginger-philes will probably love it, ginger-haters should stay well clear, and people somewhere in between might like it with a bit of honey or sugar.",Neutral
"You don't need to put sugar, this is an all-in-one ginger lemon mix.  All it requires is a cup of hot water.  The Gold Kili has a strong ginger taste and a very subtle lemon taste.  The powder smell wonderful, but once you pour it into the water, there is a weird chemical taste.  I prefer the simpler and more natural mix that we have tried before available at most oriental stores.<br /><br />Still, it is good if you have tired throat.",Neutral
"I didn't really love this drink mix, nor did I hate it either. It was just ""ok"". It does mix well and didn't have a bad after taste but the actual taste itself is underwhelming. I think maybe if you like Ginger more than I do you would like it better than I did.",Neutral
"As a fan of Stash Lemon-Ginger tea, this Gold kili product seemed promising.  I received a single packet to try in with one 8 oz. (250ml) cup of hot water from the Vine program.  So this commentary is from a single usage.  The ingredients are: Ginger, Honey (Fructose, Glucose and Sucrose) and Natural Lemon Flavor.<br />Given that I regularly drink tea and in fact Stash Ginger-Lemon tea;  I'm used to sweetener as optional and not included. I didn't like this aspect of this product as for the most part, I never add sugar to any beverage.  But, I wanted to keep an open mind.<br /><br />The product mixed up easily with hot water and was a cloudy yellow-orange. It was not as dark as the one shown in the product page.  The ginger was strong (which I like) and the lemon astringent (so-so).  I found that odd, as usually sugar balances the overall bitterness of lemon. However overall it had a pleasant taste and you ended up with a little burn in your mouth due to the ginger at the end.<br /><br />I think I would purchase this if it did not have honey in it, as a reasonable substitution for the Stash tea. Mind you, this product costs twice as much.",Neutral
"Except for a cold bottle of high-quality ginger ale, I don't often reach for ginger drinks unless for medicinal purposes. With that mindset, I tried Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix and almost wished I had saved the experience for the next time I'm stricken with a cold or flu.<br /><br />There's plenty of ginger spice here. And lemon...and an aftertaste that wasn't pleasant. Whether you call it `spicy' or `tangy' or `zesty', the drink is cloyingly gingered. I happen to like that when I'm drinking <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048KFVMU"">Reed'S Ginger Beer Extra Ginger Brew</a> on a hot, summer day. However, I can't recommend Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix unless you are already sick and in need of ginger to soothe your condition.<br /><br />I tested and reviewed this drink as part of Amazon's Vine program, receiving one packet for free. Too bad they didn't send a couple more. I wanted to share a cup with a couple of my foodie friends to hear their take. I'm tempted to place an order using Amazon's Subscribe & Save program: six boxes for $19.29 ($0.48 / oz), but I'm thinking I'm might grow tired of this after the first box or two.<br /><br />Rating: Three stars.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well, I'm sick. A head cold. Runny nose. Head congestion. The works. So, I tried Gold Kili again, taking my own advice from the initial review. Sure enough, the head cold dampens my taste buds, which in turn takes the edge off this ginger beverage. I can recommend this beverage if you have a head cold. Good luck.",Neutral
"The Gold Kili Ginger Lemon drink is for people who really like ginger- others beware. There's enough ginger in a one-cup serving to give that warm and tingly feeling as it goes down. It's not too sweet for my taste and the lemon flavor is more or less in the background. Gold Kili makes a pleasant hot drink to enjoy during the colder months, and many believe that ginger helps an upset stomach and aids the digestive process. One could make a similar, and probably better, concoction using fresh ingredients, but these instant mixes are for convenience. It's not something that I'd buy regularly, but Gold Kili isn't bad for what it is.",Neutral
"The ginger flavor here is great if you like ginger (which I do), but when mixed according to directions, I found it too sweet (disclaimer: I don't like things as sweet as others do).<br /><br />Others however may find the amount of ginger to be too strong and medicinal.  For those who don't like ginger as much, you could try diluting it with water, but when I tried that, I still found the sweetness to be too strong and out of balance.<br /><br />I really like that it has simple real ingredients.  With only three ingredients (ginger, lemon, honey), you could easily mix up something like this to the strength you prefer.<br /><br />However, this dry packet which quickly dissolves in hot water is a great convenience product for work or traveling or camping, etc.  It also might make a good marinade or rub for something like ginger-lemon chicken or fish.",Neutral
"This drink had a strong taste of ginger and a little bit of honey and lemon.  I found the ginger was almost over powering.  This was mostly ok, I would drink it if someone gave it to me but I don't think I would bother to purchase it.  You could probably get the same effect with lemon zinger tea, a little bit of real honey and some dry ginger powder and it would cost a fraction of the price of this.",Neutral
"I read many of the reviews on this product before deciding to give it a try myself. I enjoy both lemon and ginger, so I thought there would be a fair chance that I would like this beverage.  I decided to have it one afternoon instead of a cup of coffee and here are my thoughts. It smelled very good after the hot water was added, I used 8-9 ounces.  On my first sip I was overwhelmed by the ginger. Obviously I expected ginger and lemon, but I was hoping that they would be in equal parts so that one didn't overpower the other; this was not the case. I continued to drink it, but after about a 1/4 of the cup I couldn't go on. I thought maybe if I diluted it a bit more that it would be okay, but while this lessened the ginger it made the lemon barely noticeable. Overall this drink isn't bad, it's just not for me.",Neutral
"I absolutely love ginger in every form - fresh, crystallized, powdered, ginger beer, etc. I was excited to try Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix. I filled the teakettle with purified water, poured the contents of the packet into my favorite mug, and waited for the whistle to sound. When the water was ready, I poured it into the mug and stirred until I could smell the aroma of sweet ginger filling the air. It doesn't get much better than this, I thought.<br /><br />I was wrong. I took my first sip and actually considered spitting it out because it was so over-the-top intense. I figured I had made a mistake in measuring out the water, so I grabbed a larger mug--very large--transferred the contents and poured in another 4-5 ounces of water. After another thorough stir, I took a taste and had the same reaction: this is too much! I let the mixture cool and put in some ice cubes to transform the stew into a cod drink. It didn't help.<br /><br />In the end, I determined that the makers of Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix have created a drink that will probably appear to ginger fanatics or health nuts. If you are in either of those camps, have at it. For the rest of us, a nice pouch of ginger tea will do quite nicely, thank you.",Neutral
"The drink mix comes in a foil packet that is not easy to open. You'll need scissors.<br /><br />According to the instructions, you need to add hot water, so it is easy to prepare.<br /><br />I was surprised at how spicy the drink was. It's similar to chai tea, though you can also taste the honey and lemon flavors. I like spicy foods and drinks, so I thought it was fairly tasty, though the flavor had a slightly-off taste.<br /><br />I tried it first as a hot drink. However, since it was a fairly warm day I added ice cubes. Either way is fine, though it reminds me of the kind of thing I would drink if I was suffering from a cold.<br /><br />I suspect it's a healthier drink than most, but 70 calories a glass is a bit steep for me.",Neutral
"I love ginger, but this was a bit too much. I couldn't taste anything but ginger and it burned my mouth more than I like.  Ginger is great for digestion and the ingredients seem wholesome enough.  So if you are drinking purely for health reasons,ok.  However I prefer to simply eat ginger rather than not enjoy a beverage.  The honey and lemon were lost on me.  I didn't HATE this drink, but it wasn't something. I will recommend to friends or keep on hand.",Neutral
"I love ginger which is why I tried Gold Kili.  Unfortunately at the recommended strength it was too strong for me.  For someone who eats crystalized ginger that's rather surprising.  And the flavor is good when hot, but once it cools down, it has a peculiar and not very pleasant quality to it.<br /><br />All things considered, I'm not sold on this, though if I wasn't concerned that it's what's made me sick today, I'd be willing to try it again at about half strength.<br /><br />Strange product.  If you love ginger, try it, but use caution.",Neutral
"Ginger, lemmon and honey?  That sounds like a decent combination, so I picked this instant mix to try out.<br /><br />When I first opened the packet I smelled lemon and wondered where the ginger was.  But then after sipping this, I quickly learned that the ginger is in the drink!  Soon my mouth and then my lips smacked of ginger, and it got worse with each sip.<br /><br />This is caffeine free, and for people enjoying a hot drink late at night that won't turn them into zombies, this is an option.  The lemon and honey naturally sweeten this drink, but the more you drink this, the more your lips burn.  This may be perfect for that ginger lover in some, but it's definitely a taste sensation that requires getting used to.",Neutral
"I love ginger and love trying new teas, so I was excited to try this product.  This is an instant beverage mix that come in a pouch and can actually be served in two ways, either cold or hot.<br /><br />I choose to try this product hot, as a tea.  There was no steeping involved:  the instructions simply stated to add boiling water and then to serve immediately.  I did like the ginger flavor, but I think it was the lemon that gave this product and odd taste, sort of syrup-y and medicinal.<br /><br />In the end, as a hot beverage, this was just okay--drinkable, but that's about it.  I much prefer Yogi Tea's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009F3QLG"">Yogi Ginger, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> (they also make a Lemon Ginger for those who want the lemon flavor as well; I  prefer without, but Yogi's certainly does not have the odd taste of this tea).",Neutral
"I regularly put lemon juice in a glass of water because it is refreshing. I use fresh ginger root in cooking. I drink hot tea 2-3 times a week. I had hight hopes for this beverage. I tried it hot. The lemon came through, then the ginger, then the feeling of heat. But the after taste was like medicine. I added some honey. It was an improvement but nothing I cared to have again. I give it a neutral rating because it has the lemon-ginger flavor advertised, but its not something I want to drink.",Neutral
"I make ginger tea all winter long--it is hot, free of caffeine and it's a good anti-inflammatory (or it seems to to me.) I make it fresh by peeling, mashing and steeping fresh gingerroot in hot water, then straining and mixing with a scant tsp of honey. It's good. But it's a bit messy to make so this is a handy way to have ginger tea at work, where I'm not able to cut, mash or strain anything, well, except eye strain.<br /><br />The sweetness comes from dried honey powder. I found it a bit sweet for my tastes, but this is good and better than if sweetened with sugar. I don't make my tea with lemon, so this is a nice change. Some people claim that you can cure nausea with ginger tea, but I have not tested that assumption.",Neutral
"I've never had tea before that was in this form. But it really isn't tea. As the name states it is a ""beverage"" not a tea. It comes in a packet that dissolves in hot water. Gold Kili has a very strong (spicy) ginger flavor. It is difficult to describe taste in writing, but I'll try to be clear that this is a very very strong ginger spice. If you like it very strong, I am sure you mayenjoy this. As a ""beverage mix"" (in contrast to tea) it does save you having to wait for tea to steep because it dissolves instantly. In addition you don't have to clean up a tea bag. It also has sugar (sucrose) already mixed in.<br /><br />The downside is that if you prefer your drink without sweetener or perhaps with a no calorie sweetener like Truvia, that is not an option here because the honey is already mixed in.",Neutral
"If you like ginger, then this a delicious drink costing roughly 3 drinks for a buck. There is no nutritional information on the package, at least the sample pack that I received through the Vine program. Multiple studies have proven the effectiveness of ginger for treatment of nausea. Other reported benefits of ginger include effect on inflammation, variety of gastrointestinal symptoms like stomach cramps, allergies, and lowering cholesterol.",Neutral
"Lemon and ginger: two very strong tastes!  This is exactly what you want to drink after a big meal, these two herbs in combination, to aid digestion.<br /><br />Tastewise, this is strong stuff. I had to dilute mine quite a bit from the recommended amount of water.  It tastes fine hot, and tbh I actually prefer it cold, but in between, where it's just warm? It's pretty unpleasant tasting and overpowering.<br /><br />I don't think I'd drink this as an energy drink, but as a post-dinner sort of cool sipping drink, this is quite refreshing.",Neutral
"Unfortunately, I made the mistake of emptying the contents into a coffee cup without coming here first to see if it needed watered down more.  The taste was way too strong using a 1 packet to 1 cup ratio for me.  I can definitely see how you would have to build yourself up to a full strength serving.",Neutral
"There is no question that when it comes down to herbal drinks, they can be either good or lack of taste. For Gold Kili All Instant Ginger & Lemon beverage, they made a ginger all the way drink. The smell of the drink isn't bad, but yet the taste is definitely awful. It feels and tastes like you are eating a giant piece of ginger root from the supermarket produce aisle. Sadly, you not only get that taste, but you don't taste enough of the lemon essence inside that said it was suppose to be mixed within the drink. Overall, the next time I taste a ginger and lemon drink, there could be a bit better of a mix than all ginger. For that, I would rather taste a sip of ginger ale.<br /><br />Price: C<br /><br />Taste: C-<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2-",Neutral
"I enjoyed this one evening when my stomach was slightly upset. The gentle ginger flavoring helped to soothe my tummy, and being warm, it just gave me a feel good sense.<br /><br />I didn't find it exceptional, but if faced without my favorite hot beverage available, I would probably purchase this for a substitute.",Neutral
"This product is very strong, very pungent. I love strong ginger flavor, but this was way beyond my tolerance.  It literally felt like my mouth was burning.  I diluted it in 12 oz of water but it was still unpleasant. Finally I decided to add it to 8 oz of green tea as a flavoring, and it made a delicious 20 oz mug.  I would buy this only as a flavoring for a cup of regular hot tea, which was quite delicious that way.",Neutral
If you like ginger then you will love this drink.  The aroma is amazing.  I think if I had a cold I would feel better just smelling this stuff.  It is very strong and I would make 2 cups from package rather than one.  I would give it 4 stars if it weren't for the heartburn.,Neutral
"An ""All-Natural"" instant ginger and lemon beverage sounds good, as long as it has the ""WOW Factor"" that makes us keep wanting to buy. As the sample size I received did not allow me to make a more informed judgement, it had to have an immediate WOW Factor, which it did not. Perhaps if I had received a larger sample, the opinion expressed here might have been different. What I can say is that those who already love this sort of beverage will buy more while those unacquainted with it may just stay so until a better review comes their way.",Neutral
"As consumers of Gold Kili regular/plain [[ASIN:B001EPPLWM  Ginger Drink]], this beverage ranks far below and tastes bitter.<br /><br />The other concern is its ""Natural Lemon Flavour"" ... what is this exactly?  The manufacturer does not list the 'artificial' ingredients, nor does the packaging indicate 'real' citrus juice.  The question is, what are we consuming?",Neutral
"I like ginger in food, and this does taste like lemon and ginger with a peppery punch of an after taste, but it was just to strong for me, I think it would be better poured over cabbage as a soup base.",Neutral
"I don't have much experience with ginger drinks, but I kept an open mind when trying this product.  The smell was pleasant but the taste is simply too strong for me.  I was only able to finish half of the cup due to the power of the drink.  I think this product is only for ginger lovers.<br /><br />Packaging and instructions are straight forward.  Instructions are in English, French, and I believe Spanish.  Packets have a little incision for easy opening w/o scissors or a knife.",Neutral
"Overall, this product was decent.  In some respects, it was reminiscent of mixing up a packet of Theraflu, where the taste is a bit strong and the flavor is all right but you nevertheless feel comforted by the fact that you've a hot, aromatic beverage in your hands.  A serviceable instant drink that might be preferred by those with a strong penchant for ginger.",Neutral
"While I like the gingery punch of this instant beverage, I did not care for the lemon.  It tasted like someone dropped a lemon drop in it.  Yes, there was lemon but it tasted fake and cloyingly sweet.  I enjoyed the initial sips but as I got to the bottom the sweetness and the fakey lemon flavor overwhelmed.  The packet dissolved nicely and there was not a pile of residue in the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />I think this is  a nice substitute for regular tea and is probably great if you are suffering from a cold. It is warming but I found the lemon undertones off putting.",Neutral
"This little package smells really good of ginger when I opened it. It was easy to rip open. The directions were simple, to empty contents and add hot water and stir. It says 250ml of water but it would have been nice if it also said ounces, as I am not used to measuring liquids in milliliters.<br /><br />The little crystals/powder of drink mix dissolved in the hot water well and had a wonderful aroma of ginger float up.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the drink to be quite so sweet. The second ingredient is honey and it is very strong. I am not a huge fan of sweet drinks and the sweetness was more than I'd like.<br /><br />Overall it's not a bad drink and if you have an upset stomach, ginger and honey are very good for that. The lemon is subtle but it is there and noticeable. If I liked sweeter drinks I'd probably have liked it more.",Neutral
"If you enjoy fresh ginger, you will enjoy this tea.  It is probably very good for a cold or sore throat, as well as just a refreshing drink.<br /><br />Personally, I found that it was much too strong for me.  It left my mouth feeling as though I had eaten a piece of fresh ginger.  I like ginger cookies and gingerbread, but this was too much for me.  I wouldn't have known that there was lemon in the tea if it hadn't been listed.<br /><br />It's easy to fix, and is just right in sweetness.",Neutral
"I looked at the other reviews for this drink, noticed that many said the ginger was way strong. I thought ""Well, I really like ginger, so it'll be ok."" But, really, it's STRONG. Mixing with the instructed 240ml (1 cup) of water leaves a very gingery drink. However, diluting it with about another half-cup of water brought the ginger down to a nice level. At this point it was just SWEET, like ginger tea with 2 packets of Splenda. Way too sweet for me.<br />The lemon is of course overpowered by the ginger. This wouldn't really be a problem if it wasn't so sweet.<br /><br />The one thing I really did like was drinking it with a sore throat. Swollen, aching throat loves ginger, lemon, and hot beverages in general. The Gold Kili drink felt quite nice on my throat and I didn't mind the sweetness or strength of the ginger as much as I probably would normally.<br />Also, it takes a few sips to get used to the flavor. By the time I was almost finished it didn't seem nearly as strong.<br /><br />Coming upon a packet of this, I wouldn't turn it down, but I probably wouldn't buy it. I'd much rather just get tea, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG87Q"">Stash Premium Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea</a>, and sweeten it with honey myself.",Neutral
This was a pretty good drink however I barely taste lemon.  Ginger is strong and it is very strong in this drink so it is not suprising that the lemon is overpowered.  If you really like ginger I would recommend this product.  I like ginger but I was expecting a nice lemon/ginger mix.  It is not bad but I would not purchase.,Neutral
There is no question that Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix is made from ginger. The smell and taste is strong. I would suggest you start off light and continue too add the mix until you reach the strength of flavor you desire. I could not imagine how strong a bite this drink would have if not cut with honey. I do agree that with the advertisement that this is a strong ginger drink with a unique taste. My first sip shocked my taste buds that I almost did not continue to drink any. I did continue too and as I started too adjust to the flavor. The drink was not bad and it still had the ginger bite I wanted but this is not a blend I would seek out. I would drink but never buy it. Though flavorful; I did not find the experience enjoyable. The crystals do instantly dissolve to make this spicy beverage. And with the taste...I hope it is good for you.,Neutral
"I love the taste of ginger - in foods, soda, dried and jam. The thought of a refreshing and relaxing ginger drink aroused my interest. My single sample arrived in a huge box. The ""green"" in me cringed; first warning. Then the packet had only the instruction of ""mixing with 250 ml of water"". Second warning.  How long should I steep it? no idea. When the drink was, what I thought was ready,i.e. mixed with the correct amount of hot water, I tried it - wow, the ginger taste was intense! I added 1/2 again the amount of water and reheated it. This was better, but still very powerful. I went back to the packaging to see the make-up of the product -no information was provided; a description of some of the ingredients does come on the full supply box but I did not have that to see. (I went back to the listing for this fact). Strike three. Then I checked the caloric content - still no details. Maybe that is on the box, but that was nowhere to my knowledge. The fourth and fatal blow. I cannot recommend this product as it tastes too strong, has no indication of specifically what it is made of and no caloric details. Too bad, the concept was good.",Neutral
"After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to use only half a packet when adding hot water, as I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the strong ginger taste.  However, I noticed that when I only used half a packet, it tasted too sweet, so I added the rest of it - and that's when I could really taste the ginger.  You would definitely keep feeling the ginger taste in your mouth after you stop drinking.  For me though, it wasn't so much the ginger as it was the drink just being too much on the sweeter side for me (I rarely add anything sweet to tea). I probably would try another product by this manufacturer, but I don't think I would try this particular drink again.",Neutral
"The little silver pouches are a ginger lover's dream. Whether served hot (as I drink it) or cold, the crystals dissolve instantly, emitting only a slight hint at what lies in store at the first sip. The ginger will strike the back of your throat and make itself known, overwhelming any hint of lemon in the drink. The strength of ginger is not something that most people are ambivalent about, you either enjoy it or not. If this is to your taste you will like this tea as you long as you adjust the relative strength by adding more or less water to the mix.",Neutral
"This instant ginger lemon drink has a very strong ginger component with with a lighter lemon flavor.  It is a sweet drink, though not quite as sweet as many sodas.<br /><br />I prepared the powdered drink as directed with 250ml (1 cup) of hot water.  The granules in the packet dissolved quickly and the resulting beverage is actually a tannish brown color.<br /><br />I am just getting over a sore throat and I can see how a hot drink like this might be soothing and clear our my nose when I have a cold.  I certainly felt the ginger making a spicy burning sensation in the back of my throat.<br /><br />I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get this drink again, but it's not bad, either.  Those who are big fans of very strong and spicy ginger flavor would probably like it.<br /><br />Usually I'd probably prefer something like a ginger ale, or if I have a cold, hot tea or broth.<br /><br />One funny aspect about receiving this drink was that Amazon shipped me my packet of ginger drink in a giant box something like 20""x16""x8"" (with air padding packs).  This is for a small packet of drink that could easily fit in a padded envelope.  I'm not sure if this was because they were out of smaller packing or if they thought I needed a large box for returning something.  It was pretty comical when I opened a huge box and saw the small packet of drink mix in the middle.",Neutral
"I suppose this drink isn't tea. It just says that it is a beverage so I am assuming that the tea aspect is not going to be the major factor in the drinking of this. Still it tastes like lemon tea so I am going to review it from the fact that it is a hot drink that is suited for making you relax and think about your life or something.<br /><br />Still, I am not the biggest fan of ginger in the world. For someone who does not like ginger, this drink is too reminiscent of the ""cinnamon gum"" I used to attempt to chew as a kid. It's too sharp to be tasty and I am drinking it thinking ""why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you?"" only to realize that I had made it in the first place. It tastes like lemon tea that got a very sharp and spicy kick that doesn't entirely please me.<br /><br />I think if I had time to drink many cups, I would learn to love it. I didn't like coffee when I first had it either. Still I am uncertain that I can fully recommend it since it is too ginger and too lemon and it doesn't feel right.",Neutral
"I found this ginger-lemon tea to be so-so. Although I mixed the powder and water quite well, I found the taste inconsistent.  Some sips had an overpowering ginger taste.  Other times the flavor was more moderate and the lemon taste was reflected.  In the end, I found that this had too strong of an aftertaste, a sensation similar to that experienced with some artificial sweeteners.  If you like Gold-kilis other products, or if you like very strong ginger flavored drinks, this is for you.  If not, you may wish to try another product.",Neutral
"I sampled Kali Ginger and Lemon drink mix on a cold wintry day when my throat was a bit inflamed and sore.  I drank it hot as directed on the foil pouch.  To be honest, the first few sips burned quite a bit as they went down due to the ginger, but as I continued to drink, the lemon and honey flavors came to the fore.  After finishing the whole cup, my throat felt a little bit better, and I realized that overall, I had liked the beverage.<br /><br />That said, the big question is: did I like it well enough to order more?  And my honest answer is: probably not.  Gold Kali Ginger & Lemon is one of those products that I might enjoy on a rare occasion, but not one that I'm tempted to stock up on and make part of my regular diet.  There will definitely be a group of consumers that this spicy drink will appeal to, and to them, I heartily recommend it.  But as for me, a man who enjoys more traditional warm and cold beverages, let's just say that it really isn't my cup of tea.",Neutral
"This drink is spicy! It's surprising how much of a kick that ginger has, and the honey and lemon are nearly drowned out in the ginger flavor. I drank it warm, and it was a nice and soothing beverage on a cold day. I use ginger a lot for its anti-nausea effects, and I could see trying this to help combat motion sickness. That said, even watered down slightly, the kick was still a lot for me and it was rather hard to drink the entire cup in one sitting.",Neutral
"This tea is very hot and spicy.  The directions say to pour the contents of a pouch into a cup of hot water.  This was way too strong for me, and I had to add another cup of water into it in order to drink it.  I was hoping that the lemon would be the dominant flavor with just a hint of ginger, but it is actually the opposite.  If you enjoy ginger or teas that are hot and spicy, you may enjoy this.  For me, it was way too much ginger.",Neutral
"It's very easy to prepare.  Just pour the powder into a cup and add hot water.  The ginger taste is very strong and spicy.  There is minimal lemon flavor.  For my own taste, I had to add more water to dilute the brew to make it less strong.",Neutral
"A while ago, a Chinese friend made me ginger tea using slices of ginger root and honey. She raved about the medicinal powers of ginger, and I enjoyed it, but I knew I would never take the time to replicate it myself. So I was interested to try Gold Kili's instant ginger & lemon drink to see how it measured up to authentic Chinese ginger tea. Amazingly, it tasted exactly like the tea my friend made for me!<br /><br />It's pretty strong, but that can easily be regulated by adding more than the recommended 250 ml (approximately 1 cup) of water. I couldn't taste any lemon at all, and since I only got one packet without any ingredient or nutritional information, I don't know if there's really any lemon in it.<br /><br />The ginger ""kick"" is pretty strong, and the tea tasted medicinal, so probably the only time I would use it would be for a sore throat. Still, I'd recommend this product to anyone who enjoys ginger tea--this is certainly easier than making it from scratch, and you get the same result!",Neutral
"I would totally drink this if I were sick.  It has that natural medicine taste, almost reminding me of lemon Theraflu. I'm not sure if that's an insult to this product, or a compliment to Theraflu.  It has a strong ginger flavor with an under-taste of lemon.<br /><br />The instructions are in English, French, and Spanish.  Note, 250ml is equivalent to 1 cup of water - all the instructions are in metric.  The drink is just mixed  with hot water, not unlike instant coffee.<br /><br />I received this sample from the Amazon Vine program.  The sample did not come with ingredients, or any marketing information.<br /><br />I would be more likely to drink this product if it were marketed as a health drink.  It isn't bad, but I wouldn't drink it for pleasure.",Neutral
"A single pouch of this tea makes a small very strong cup of ginger flavored tea. The small grains dissolved instantly. I could not taste any lemon flavor and very little if any honey flavor. The Ginger was almost medicinally strong and somewhat bitter, though it did not sting the throat like fresh ginger does at this intensity, nor did it clear the sinus. I think this is too strongly flavored to accompany most food, though it might go well with some cookies or possibly cheese. I do not know if it would be effective for motion sickness or other nausea and so far as I can tell this is being marketed as a beverage. It is not particularly sweet but also has none of the tartness one expects from lemon. The strength reminded me of  a very strong ginger ale without the fizz.  I can see that this might be convenient to take on the road  but for day to day use I think I will stick with making my own ginger, lemon and Honey drinks with fresh ingredients.",Neutral
"I wasn't for sure what a warm ginger flavored product would be like, but I wanted something with lemon for fighting Spring allergy symptoms.  Often during the Spring I get sore throat & congestion issues - the best remedy is warm liquids.  Since high caffeine drinks like tea & coffee are not ideal for nighttime, then I've explored many lemon based drinks like this to use.  I can say among those I've tried this is not as lemony as many of the others and the ginger taste is a little overwhelming.  I like ginger ale and eat ginger flavored items, but as a drink this was a little much.  If I was sick, this might help but the taste would make me not want to finish a whole serving.  So all and all, make sure you are a fan of the spiciness of ginger - this is key for knowing whether Gold Kill's Ginger & Lemon Beverage is right for you.",Neutral
"Perhaps Gold Kili Ginger & Lemon beverage mix is better suited to a true, traditional Asian palate, as ginger is a very popular spice in many Asian dishes. I, myself, happen to be a BIG fan of ginger. I enjoy eating pieces of candied and crystallized ginger on a regular basis both for its breath-freshening properties, as well as to make my mouth sweeter (and more kissable!), and to soothe my stomach. My favorite granola is one from Trader Joe's that contains slivers of candied ginger. Ginger is just something that I miss when I go for too long without it. On that note, this drink DOES have an initial potent kick of ginger, at first sip, but the flavor after that first sip seems to be pretty weak and ambiguous. Is this supposed to be kinda like the ginger beer that I grew up seeing my mom enjoy on a regular basis? Is it supposed to be similar to a ginger ale, but with a little (well-nigh undetectable, and synthetic-tasting) lemon to punch it up? I really wasn't quite sure.<br /><br />The drink isn't sweet enough to really count as a soft drink, and overall, aside from a drink with a bit of punch and somewhat waning - or at least perhaps slightly old-tasting - ginger kick, I couldn't quite figure out what Gold Kili was trying to present here.<br /><br />I had my pouch cold, as I'm most likely to drink most of my beverages that way. Not sure if it would've been better hot, but I just wasn't a fan of this. Potent ginger flavor, odd, almost absent lemon flavor, not sweet enough, and I feel that I should be able to enjoy a product straight out of the package, as it's sold. If I have to do a bunch of gussying up of it in order to make it palatable, it needs some tweaking before going out on the store shelves, at least as far as I'm concerned...",Neutral
"I love ginger in every form, so I was really looking foward to drinking this beverage.  I thought it was OK, but not that special.  The lemon flavor was good and the honey did add some sweetness.  But, I prefer a stronger ginger flavor.",Neutral
"Some reviewers here have complained that the Gold Kili Ginger Lemon beverage is too hot - and I can readily see that it might be for some tastes. This stuff has a peppery burn that you WILL feel...although that's actually a quality I like (my favorite soda is Blenheim's Red Cap ginger ale, which is basically like the acid that runs through the creature's veins in ""Alien."") So I've got no complaints about the ginger in this drink, but found myself unhappy with the other two flavors: lemon and honey.<br /><br />The ginger is so strong that it could really be matched well with tart lemon...but the lemon flavor was almost undetectable. There was no problem tasting the honey, though (although it wasn't super strong). Unfortunately, I don't usually care for the taste of honey in my drinks, so even a little was a bit too much.<br /><br />Overall, I found it a thin and watery beverage which was peppery hot, but otherwise lacking in flavor except for the slightly cloying sweetness. I'm giving it 3 stars because the same tastes I found unsatisfying might be exactly what someone else is looking for (and ginger IS good for you).",Neutral
"Well, it seems theoretically impossible that this induced an asthma attack. So perhaps THAT was a coincidence. I may of course be allergic to an ingredient or preservative in this. I inhaled, my throat constricted...attempted two sips...and couldn't breath. I don't have many food allergies either. Perhaps it was just the strength of this brew. Do check out the ingredient list if you're alkergy prone (the single packet sent by Vine didn't include ingredients).  I like lemon. I like ginger(find it wonderful for settling an upset stomach), I love hot teas (usually very asthma friendly).  But this...was very, very strong. Tastewise, it not bad just strong. I would suggest diluting it a bit. It looks kind of like apple cider when mixed, rather like little bits of a fibersupplement when not, lol. But ive never felt so wheezy with a tea or ginger or lemon! I'm giving it 2 stars because I cant honestly say I like it, even though I like things in in its category.  I felt the taste would be much improved by dilution, though. Also, only two stars Bc I'm suspicious about the respiratory issue that prevented me from trying it further. Ok ok, that couldbe coincidence.....  so three stars.",Neutral
"I've never tried a ginger tea before.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but wow this was an eye opener.  I brewed it hot as the directions suggested.  I never thought about adding sugar (I normally do with tea) and that's a good thing because it is already sweetened with honey. I waited for it to cool down a bit and then I took a sip.  My first impression was that I had messed up and this wasn't really a product intended for consumption.  You get a quick medicine taste followed by a burning sensation very similar to a hot salsa with a lemon tang to it.  The initial shock probably made it worse than it should have been.  I continued (much more carefully) to sip it and it's not undrinkable.  I went three stars because I understand that I just tend to not like very strong tastes like this, but others may.  Also, reading a few other reviews I'm getting the impression that ginger teas do tend to have a bite...  that said if you like ginger and like VERY strong tastes you may very well enjoy this tea.  (At this time there are several 5 star reviews) Just be warned, this sure isn't lipton.  If you buy, I hope you enjoy and thank you for taking the time to read my review.",Neutral
"Interesting and surprising flavor.  Mix with 1 cup hot water.  Color a light mustard brown.  What is immediately noticeable when swallowed is that it is rather surprisingly spicy.

"Everyone's taste is a little different, so let's try looking at this more logically by breaking down statements from the official description:<br /><br />=========><br />Gold Kili's Instant Ginger Lemon Beverage Mix is made from top grade ginger and honey to give a unique taste, providing goodness and fragrance when consumed. Enhanced with tangy natural lemon flavor,the taste is certainly refreshing.<br />&lt;=========<br /><br />It certainly is fragrant. It may not be as good as burning a lemon-scented candle, but it did give a fresh, lemony smell to the area -- better than lemon-scented cleaning products.<br /><br />But I couldn't *taste* the lemon. There's an undertone of sourness, but bitter ginger dominates. The honey apparently keeps it from being too bitter. It does NOT have any sweet flavor.<br /><br />And actually, the bitter flavor reminds me more of black pepper than it does ginger.<br /><br />=========><br />Traditionally, ginger is used as-a spice to flavor food, however, people from many countries around Asia e g. India, China, Indonesia, etc, consume ginger products for motion sickness, to aid digestion and to restore the balance in the body. The inner foil envelope contains instantly dissolving crystals that make a spicy beverage. You can control the depth of favor by how much you add to you cup.<br />&lt;=========<br /><br />While it is strong, I'm not sure making it weaker by adding more water does any good. You either like the flavor, or you don't. I suspect I would like it better if I had a cold, as this stuff really cuts through! It feels good in my tummy, too.<br /><br />But, again, this is not a ""refreshing"" beverage. This is a slap-you-in-the-face bitter cup of something.<br /><br />The crystals did dissolve instantly when the hot water hit them. There was nothing to stir. No sediment.<br /><br />My first reaction was, ""This is horrible,"" but I decided to sally forth, and drink at least most of the cup before making my judgement. It did grow on me, but not enough that I'm likely to buy it. It's just not my cup of tea.<br /><br />But if you like a bitter mix of ginger flavor (that I still think in this case tastes more like black pepper, even though I can smell ginger) tempered with a little sour lemon, and, presumably, enough honey to keep it from killing you, this might be for you.<br /><br />The hotter, and spicier you like your foods, the more appreciation that I'm sure you'll have for this. But if you're looking for a sweatish, lemony beverage that's refreshing in the way that lemonade is, this is NOT something you want to try.<br /><br />eh... maybe I will get a couple of packages to keep around for when I get a cold, and I need something powerful to taste.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is at best an acquired taste. Bitter beyond what most people would call refreshing -- but that may just be what you're into.<br /><br />Edit: One day later, and out of nowhere I have a craving for this stuff. I really didn't like it, so I'm not really sure why I have this craving. Wow.",Neutral
"I am a tea drinker, and I like both lemon and ginger, but I didn't find this drink to be terribly tasty. I followed the directions for making it hot and could only drink about half of it. The ginger is very strong, so if you're not a real fan of ginger, I would suggest you not bother with this product. I would like to have tried it cold as well to compare the two, but the Vine program only sent me one packet. I agree with another reviewer who commented on the large packaging that was used for such a small item. It seemed very wasteful.<br /><br />If I find this product in the store, I might give it another try cold and update my review.",Neutral

"I tried this as a hot drink, and I have to say that I found it completely unpalatable (three sips into the drink I had to pour it out, as I could not take any more). I can conceive of only using this as a medicinal drink for upset stomach, nausea or vomiting. I don't dislike the flavor of ginger, in fact I like it as a mild seasoning when cooking, or as a light flavor in sweets, but this was totally overpowering, to the point where I could hardly notice the lemon and honey flavors.<br /><br />In my line of work I routinely recommend ginger for GI upset, this drink is so overpowering, though, that I would have to caution users to use it for extreme cases of nausea/vomiting only, unless they have a strong tolerance for the flavor.

"Ginger is a naturally healthy remedy that is used for calming the stomach, seasickness, stimulating circulation/metabolism and is even good for arthritis. It's lingering spiciness is not appealing to everyone. Ginger Tea directions recommend 350 ml  (about 8.5 ounces) of hot water per packet. One mouthful at that strength was TOO STRONG for me. Too spicy initially and lingering spiciness for awhile afterwards. It did make me sweat so I can see using it as a cold remedy to naturally break a fever, calm the tummy and a worthy addition to the medicine cabinet. I did add an additional cup of hot water to the mix to make it palatable but the spiciness still lingered.<br /><br />I didn't find the tipping point where sipping this Ginger Tea became a pleasureable experience I'd enjoy on a regular basis. This is definitely NOT for the BLAND crowd. I  didn't discern lemon OR honey with either the original version or with the additional hot water, just spiciness. Although I can see the medicinal benefits of Ginger Tea, it's NOT my cup of tea.<br /><br />UPDATE: 4/10/2012 After Dr. recommended I cut back on caffeine I needed a warm drink that didn't leave me craving another like my ""coffee treats"". The flashback of this beverage returned. I ordered the pack of 6 and drink ONLY ONE A DAY compared to the 3 coffee treats a day - sure the calorie reduction will show eventually. The lingering spiciness is not conducive to munching any snacks either = less caloric intake. I've even used the mixed beverage with soy sauce and a splash of vinegar as a base for veggie soups. The lingering spicy ginger flavor leaves me feeling satisfied and minimizes my ""grazing"".<br /><br />***STILL 3 STARS so not to sway readers that it's the best thing since sliced bread.

"I really like fresh, hot ginger in food, tea or candy but this ginger is extreme.  It leaves a burning sensation in the throat similar to eating horseradish; not pleasant.  I made it following the instructions which is with a cup of hot water.  I did not care for it & neither did my spouse.  So then I added several ice cubes to make an iced version; that was better.  But even iced, it's still too sweet for my taste.  However, if you like southern iced ""sweet tea"", you may like this.  It really reminded me of that flavor & sweetness.  There is a nice hint of lemon. The ginger burn was also minimized by drinking it iced.  But even so, I ended up dumping the rest down the drain.  It's just not my kind of drink & getting a sore throat is not enjoyable.<br /><br />The flavors of this drink do taste real - not icky fake tasting which is good.  If you like hot, burning ginger & sugary sweet taste, you may like this.",Neutral
"Since I decided to drastically reduce my caffeine intake as well as my sodium intake, I have gotten a little bored with what I can drink.  There is too much sodium, not to mention other nasty stuff, in diet soda to keep drinking it as much as I was, and coffee has too much caffeine, so it has been a lot of water and decaffeinated teas.  Coffee and diet soda have been occasional at best.  So, when I got the chance to try Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger and Lemon Drink, I was intrigued.<br /><br />The drink comes in premeasured packets, but you can add as little or as much as you like.  The drink mix is made up of little granules.  The first thing I noticed was a very overpowering smell of lemon.  While the drink says it is all natural, the lemon smell was very fake smelling (think furniture polish) and it was hard for me to get past.<br /><br />I added the mix to hot water.  I added about half, and it seemed weak, so I added the rest.  Again, the lemon smell was overpowering.  I had a hard time getting past it enough to taste the drink.  I expected the lemon taste would be as powerful, but I was wrong.  It was the ginger taste that was very strong.  VERY strong.  Not awful, but definitely powerful, and it made the drink taste very spicy.  My tongue tingled after the first taste.<br /><br />All in all, this drink was not bad.  The ginger taste was strong and spicy, so you will need to like ginger (a lot) to really enjoy this drink.  This is way different from the ginger ale taste that most people think of when they think ginger drink.  It is similar to a ginger beer we recently tried.  I think if I was sick, this would be a great drink.<br /><br />The thing that most bothered me was, as a reviewer, I only received a single packet of the mix.  I was given absolutely no information regarding nutrition values (calories) and ingredients.  Without this information, I am very hesitant to recommend the product.",Neutral
"While this has a good taste, it was too sweet for my taste. It makes a good warm drink on a cold day, I suppose, but I prefer tea.",Neutral
"This had a really nice aroma when I opened the packet -- a mixture of the lemon and the ginger. I can taste the lemon, particularly if I hold it in my mouth for a moment, but the ginger taste is the really prevalent flavor. It has that kick to it you get when you eat fresh or pickled ginger. I enjoy it as I drink it, but there is a weird and -- to me -- unpleasant aftertaste. I would like something like this, but this actual product probably would not make it into my grocery cart.",Neutral
"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Beverage mix (Ginger & Lemon) is an all right drink-in-a-powder.  I have drank similar types of drinks in the past (Chrysanthemum, herbal and tea) and I thought I give this one a try.  I wasn't turned off by the taste but it wasn't lip smacking good either.  Its an acquired taste and if you enjoy drinking instant beverages (just add water) then you'll want to try this one out.  Veterans of powdered drinks need not apply.",Neutral
"The Gold Kili is just okay to me. I'm not a huge fan of the flavor, it too bold for me. It will settle a stomach, as the other reviewers stated. For that alone, it would be perfect for those sick days or hangover days or any day you have a little stomach bug!",Neutral
"I drank a little with cold water and with hot tea.  Later my sister and I tried it made like a tea with hot water.  She really likes ginger while I am not so keen on the stuff.

"This drink certainly has a nice and spicy ginger kick.  That made it interesting.  Other than that, it is honey sweetened.  I didn't notice the lemon flavor though - probably because I was too busy enjoying the ginger.  People that believe in that sort of thing think that ginger has some sort of curative effect.  I can't speak to that as I didn't have any ailments needing a cure.  Purely on conjecture, I think this drink would feel good on a sore throat.  I'd add whisky though.<br /><br />So, overall I found this to be an interesting drink but not one I'd push on friends, even if they're sick.  I have better recipes.",Neutral
"The color of this drink is a dark golden yellow, and the smell is of very potent ginger.  I was hopeful that it would bring the spice that ginger naturally has, and it sure did.  I liked that part of this.  What I did not like was the sugar!  Any great medicinal effects of the ginger (for nausea) would be negated with this sugar.<br />I served it hot, and it was relaxing, like tea, but too sweet in my opinion.  I do not drink sodas or put sugar in my coffee, so maybe I'm just not used to it, but I couldn't finish it because as it cooled, the sweetness seemed to get stronger.<br />Served hot, and in small doses, this could be a nice sweet after dinner drink.  I try to keep the healthy benefits of what I put in my body in mind, and ginger is always at the top of my sensitive-stomach's list, but as far as calming the stomach, it does not do the trick for me.  That sugar just upset it more.",Neutral
"I personally didn't care much for it, but I can respect it as an interesting ginger beverage. You can make it hot or cold.

It claims to be all natural, but it seemed like a taste I associate with artificial sweeteners.",Neutral
"I admit it up front:  I don't like spicy food or spicy drinks.  I hate pepper with a passion as well as other ""hot"" spices.  I will occasionally drink ginger ale and eat gingersnap cookies, so I thought that I might like this ginger/lemon beverage.  But it had far too much kick to the ginger to suit me.  Those who like ginger and don't mind the spicyness will probably like this.  I even tried it cooled as an iced drink (which I usually prefer) and still hated it.  To be fair, since I knew that I don't like really spicy food or drink, I gave it three stars.  And I think that if they would work on it and tone down the ginger, it could be a good beverage.  But not as it is right now; at least not for me.  Also, if they're going to sell it in America, they'll have to change the instructions to show how much water to add in cups instead of using ml.  I just kept adding water and tasting it until I thought it was about where it was supposed to be, but I had no idea if I was right (and I hated it at every level) about the measurement.",Neutral
"Since ginger is good for digestion, I mixed a cup of this after I'd had a rather 'disturbing' meal.<br /><br />I mixed it with hot water and sipped it down.

You'll probably like this if you like ginger - it does have a strong ginger taste that often lingers afterwards in the form of an aftertaste.  The lemon provides an interesting counterbalance to the ginger - upon first sip it overpowers the ginger but the subtle ginger flavor often comes back as an aftertaste.  Some may prefer the aftertaste and others may not.<br /><br />What I do like is that it is an interesting and different alternative to the more common tea flavors we get in America. It definitely has a very strong Asian smell and taste that will either attract or detract.  I would say it's a matter of taste and to try just one box before buying a group.  My spouse loved the tea but I didn't care for it.,Neutral
"Years ago, a friend from India suggested that I mix ginger juice with honey and turmeric and give it to my little girl as a cough remedy.  I found that it worked great, my daughter liked the taste better than cough syrup, and I thought it tasted fantastic.  I thought this drink mix might taste kind of like that, and it does, if you taste the mix straight out of the pouch.  But when I put it in water, I used more water than recommended (after seeing a lot of comments saying that the mix was too strong), and that was a huge mistake.  If anything, it would be best in LESS water than recommended.  It's very tasty, but drinking 8 ounces of prepared drink would just be too much volume for this kind of drink.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this drink mix unless you know that you like strong ginger beverages, because the ginger flavor is very strong and spicy.  It would be great to drink (in small quantities) when you have a cold or have a sore throat.  I wish it was a little sweeter (I ended up adding more sweetener and some lemon juice).<br /><br />A small point: you should be aware that the pouches are very difficult to open because there is no ""starter"" perforation.  I needed scissors.<br /><br />Overall, this isn't a bad drink.  Just be aware of what you're getting, and start with maybe half a cup of water, then add more if you find that you would prefer something weaker.",Neutral
"An easy to make ginger and lemon beverage.<br />There is not much to say, the powder mixes easily in hot water (barely no stir). It tastes fine, if a tad sweet but you can always add more water.<br /><br />Overall ok - but much prefer to just boil a bit of water with ginger root, sprinkle in some lemon and add sugar or honey to taste.",Neutral
"I like ginger in certain situations, but I'm not sure this is one of them.  That's why I gave this 3 stars - I don't know if I like it, but I'm pretty sure I don't hate it.  I tried this hot, and it was soothing, but the ginger/honey/lemon flavor is odd to me.  Not bad, just odd.

"To people who have not tried ginger tea before, the flavor might be a little strong.  I brew ginger tea from actual ginger so Gold Kili was moderate to me.  I did find it too sweet for my taste.  It contains 3 types of sugars:  fructose, glucose, and sucrose.  For what reason, I don't know.  When I make my own tea, I just use a piece of ginger about the size of half my thumb, 16 oz. of water, which I boil for 10 minutes and let sit for another 5 and all I add is a teaspoon of brown or raw sugar.  Excellent for sore throats.  Although you can get a similar soothing effect from Gold Kili but for nearly $2 a cup, it will burn a hole in your pocket.  If convenience is the only consideration, then this product is okay.  Otherwise, I'll stick to making my own tea.",Neutral
"I have a sore throat.  I tried the product in a mug-sized coffee cup with hot water.  Tasted great and helped my throat at first.  Then it cooled.  It has so much sugary ingredients that it has an aftertaste.  I would dilute this product.  Actually, I would like a sugar-free version, but diluted.  Sugar-free products do not make my tongue feel thick in a syrupy way.  This drink does.  If it would just stay hot it would be ok.  If it were diluted it may be nicer.  I am partial to tea bags.  This is a powder, premixed.  I put stevia in my tea.  This has sugary ingredients I cannot pronounce.  It is still sugar.  Needs work.",Neutral
"I LOVE ginger. It is so good for you. It's supposed to calm a sour stomach. There are lots of good health benefits. But this herbal root also gives you such a hot zing that you feel a little more awake along with bringing joy to your taste buds. That being said, my taste buds found the level of ginger in this beverage to be a little bit much. This would be great for the diehard ginger lover OR fantastic if mixed with fruit or other fruity herbs in hot water. This product could also add zing to your conventional iced tea in the summer. So I would recommend trying it. The fact that it is a powdered compounded product adds ease to mixing it for an instant cuppa lift!

"This drink has a very strong ginger and lemon flavor.  It's actually so strong that you really need to like ginger - it actually somewhat burned my throat (so to speak).  For those that like ginger, it's probably going to be a welcome experience.  I don't like it much but to each their own!<br /><br />Also, it came in a box that was large enough to ship a hot plate!  The mailman thought the package had been compromised!",Neutral
The instructions called for adding 6oz hot water. I added 8oz but still thought the taste was quite strong. You could probably dilute it with 12oz and be fine. Even so it has a strong ginger taste -  much more so than say ginger ale. The lemon gives it a bit of acidity as well. It almost too much. The taste is not bad but there's a lot of it. Wasn't my favorite.,Neutral
"I love this tea or at least I did when I first tried it. It has a very effervescent, gingery kinda taste. Now I think my taste buds have gone numb to the stuff. And it's about 80 calories per cup, which is way too much for a cup of tea...really. So I will probably use it only once in a blue moon. But, no worries, each tea bag is nicely sealed in an aluminum paper-like bag which are all then sealed again in a larger aluminum paper-like bag. I'm tell'in you this stuff could last through the Great Tribulation and still be fresh.",Neutral
"vine sent this is a box 100 times bigger than the tea packet.  the wife made the tea and she drank it.m  mshe said that it was ok, nothing to really write home about.  she said that  it tasted like ginger ta with a touch of lemon",Neutral
"This is an instant powder that you mix with hot water.  The strongest flavor by far is ginger, which has a nice, powerful bite to it.  Behind that, I can taste some lemon and honey flavors, and the aftertaste is mostly lemon and honey.  The lemon and honey has a little bit of an ""artificial"" taste to it, but not terrible.<br /><br />This would clear your sinuses well, and if a drink made from a lot of ginger and a little lemon and honey sounds good to you, you will probably enjoy it.  Still, I think that I could do better with real ginger (either grated or jarred), lemon juice, and honey.",Neutral
"Like most other posters ahead of me, I was struck by just how much ginger there was to taste in this product. After making the drink, the smell was overwhelming but not horrible. The taste wasn't all that pleasant, with the ginger masking the lemon taste. I could detect the lemon when I was making it in the aroma, but none in the taste.<br /><br />I can imagine using this when I am sick, to open my sinuses or help clear my nose and head. But as an everyday drink, no way.",Neutral
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:13 Mins<br /><br /></span>I wish Amazon would allow a longer video so I could share the entire experience. This drink is somewhat complex if you can taste beyond the huge ginger impact of it. First there is a sweet honey-ish warmth, followed by an almost immediate rush of ginger. Next is a pepper-y taste and feel as and after it goes down. The pepper stays on the front of the mouth and the back of the throat for quite a while. Very little lemon. There is enough sweetness to be able to stand up to a healthy squeeze from a lemon wedge. Adding more water made it less intense, but was still a bit too sweet. If you enjoy a spicy sweet hot beverage, and love ginger, this might be a favorite for you.",Neutral
"I like this drink.<br /><br />But, I LOVE ginger. This has a strong ginger taste, and I think that's great. If you're more accustomed to the bland idea of a hint of ginger in some salad dressing or Asian food, then taste the real thing, straight up, first. If you don't love ginger, you will not like this product. And yes, it's a little spicy--that's the ginger!<br /><br />Next, I know that honey is more natural and sounds wholesome and everything, but it's just not my favorite sweetener. Whatever they do to powder it, along with the other sweeteners listed on the label, gives it kind of a weird aftertaste. Ginger itself is kind of sweet, and the bit of lemon is a good complement, but the aftertaste here is just weird.<br /><br />I actually think I'll go back to dumping plain old real ginger into a cup of tea, despite the need to strain the cup or ignore the dregs, for the taste I love. It's not as convenient as the little packet, but it does taste better.<br /><br />(Why three stars? It's not terrible, and was maybe even good; it's just not great.)",Neutral
"I have to admit; I have a cup of this beverage right in front of me, piping hot, and I as my three-year old son would say, ""this is not my favorite.""<br /><br />(And this is where we say, ""BUT."")<br /><br />But the poor showing of three stars I am giving this product is truly based off of the way I perceive the taste... My palate has never liked those hard honey candies that some people -- like my Dad -- adore, and that's the prime flavor I pick our instantly.  The same honey sweetness is right there on the front line of the palate.  But there are things that even I like about the product; the ginger taste soon separates itself from the honey flavor, and the after-swallow finish is very spicy, like cloves, and remains strong for some time.  It's strong spiciness does reach beyond your palate and into your sinuses - I can see this as being an excellent beverage for someone who has a cold (sore throat especially) and is looking for a zippy drink for relief.<br /><br />Also, I can see adding a shot of your favorite brandy or spiced rum to this drink to make it one of those special ""toddies"" you allow yourself in those winter times when the sniffles have got you.  In those times, I imagine even my taste buds would appreciate a Gold Kili Ginger Lemon Toddy in a hot bath.  :^)",Neutral

"This is a ginger drink. From reading the other reviews, it seems a lot of people expected it to be some sort of herbal tea-like beverage. It's not. It's a ginger drink like the kind Asians enjoy and/or use as medicine. However, it's not a particularly good one. I much prefer Prince of Peace brand: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SWB73C"">Instant Ginger Honey Crystals Pack of 30 Bags - 18 g Sachets</a><br />This Gold Kili drink doesn't have the warm spicy ginger flavor that a good ginger drink should have.

"I was kind of excited to try this tea out.  I've been looking for something that would be easy to put in my purse that would dissolve and not have fake sugars like Aspartame in it, so I was excited to see that this was sweetened by honey and lemon.<br /><br />That said, you have to REALLY love Ginger to enjoy this drink.  If you do, you will likely LOVE this tea.  I am not a huge fan of Ginger (I love to cook with it, but not have it as a main flavor), so this really wasn't my favorite drink.  I thought there should have been more lemon in it.<br /><br />It did dissolve really nicely and didn't leave a film of grit in the bottom of the glass.  I do actually want to give this tea another try... in a recipe.  I think it would be great in chicken broth or when making chicken salad.",Neutral
"Wow. Lots of ginger in this drink, anyone who in their head (like myself) makes an assumption that this is a lightly flavored beverage would be way off.<br /><br />I poured my packet into a mug of hot water. Consistency-wise this is thicker and closer to a hot chocolate or cider rather than a clear tea.  You have to really, really like ginger to like this drink.  I tried to drink as much of it as I could, but it actually overwhelmed me. I'd have to have watered it down greatly to drink a cup's worth.<br /><br />For people who really like ginger this is a great alternative to tea or hot chocolate for a warm winter drink as you get that extra zing of flavor with ginger.  The powder mixed really well and easily with the hot water.<br /><br />I won't be drinking this again, only because my love of ginger isn't that strong, but I'd recommend it to someone who did really like ginger.",Neutral
"Gold Kili All Natural Instant Ginger & Lemon Beverage Mix, 6.72-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I prepared the beverage with 8oz of hot water (about 250ml per instructions). The first sip reminds me of the Trader Joe's Ginger Candy, it packs a punch! If you are a ginger fan I think you will like this ""tea"" very much. It has a robust ginger taste with a lemony finish behind it. There is some nice sweetness to the blend too.<br /><br />For me personally, it's too strong. My taste in ginger is more to the pickled stuff served with sushi.  It's not bad, to me, but I think it's really more for people who crave ginger more than I do. I have a friend who's like that but wasn't able to share my sample with her.<br /><br />As for the actual powder that's in the foil envelope. It's a crystalline sandy colored granular powder. It dissolved quickly in the hot water from my Keurig machine. If you're in the ginger loving class of consumer, I'm betting this beverage will please.

"I admit I have been addicted to hazelnut coffee for years, especially for the first pot in the morning. Even when I find something I like I can't help but experiment.  I think I am like many coffee lovers, always looking for that perfect blend, no matter how much we may like what we already have.  I drank Harmony hazelnut for years.  It is a staple item at one of those warehouse markets here where I do my regular shopping.  There is no question that Harmony is a bargain for flavored coffee.  I think you would be hard pressed to find a better deal on a hazelnut blend anywhere, even here on Amazon.  And there is also no doubt that it is a decent coffee, I drank it for years as already stated.  However as also before mentioned, when it comes to the perfect cup of coffee, I just can't help but wonder if the grass over the next rise is really greener.  I one day picked up another Hazelnut and realized then that though the Harmony is a decent blend and great bargain, there is no doubt in mind that is it most definitely a weaker blend. Even compared to other regular supermarket brands. And I found it very ""hollow"" tasting in comparison to other fancier hazelnuts on Amazon that do not cost that much more, (like Melitta's Hazelnut Creme, much stronger).  I have since parted ways with Harmony and gone for the stronger brew in a variety of blends that cost a little bit more.  In conclusion, I recommend Harmony if you are a hazelnut junkie and have limited funds to support the habit.  However if you are someone that like me is on a never ending quest for the cup of java to die for, I suggest you skip this bargain and keep looking.  You may not settle on what I have, but it's my feeling you will come to the same conclusion that the Harmony is a good deal, but a weak competitor at best...<br /><br />PS:  A recent review of this blend has shown that it is no longer the great bargain it used to be.  Not only is Harmony not eligible for free shipping, but it is also not available for the subscription service where one gets a discount, and free shipping.  I have since lowered the rating of this coffee to 3 stars.  No longer the bargain it once was, but still just as weak...",Neutral
"The price + being organic is what drew me in to try the Stash brand... but the taste is nowhere near the Jasmine tea that I can get at my local teashop.<br /><br />I have tried several different ways of brewing, and the sweet jasmine aroma & taste is barely discernible.<br /><br />It is drinkable though, and like I said, the price was very good.  I hope to try the Numi brand next -- I have heard rave reviews about their Jasmine Pearl teas!",Neutral

"This is my first bag of chai tea and I have to say, it's extremely strong if you try to drink this straight. I can barely taste the tea itself, just a bit of bitter, and an extremely strong spice taste.<br /><br />It gets better if you water it down a lot, or take it with a lot of milk (basically a chai tea latte), which I suppose is how it's supposed to be drunk. But you start losing the base tea and only get the other spices.",Neutral
"Unlike most Stash teas, and most premium loose teas in general, this tea is not identified by a region of origin or a method of preparation.  Fittingly, the flavor is very typical of unadulterated green tea.  Before infusion, the dry leaves smell of sweet hay, but after brewing, the smell and the flavor is a bit more mild and earthy.  There are plenty of stems mixed in with the tea leaves, which is disappointing in a ""premium"" tea.  The most important thing I can say about this tea is to only infuse it for 2 - 3 minutes.  The recommended infusion time of 3 - 5 minutes is way too long and results in a very bitter cup of tea.  Overall, this is a fine tea for the price, but don't expect anything outstanding.",Neutral
"This tea has a very grassy, vegetal taste and smell, which can be good or bad depending on your preference.",Neutral
"It's not bad, as the fragrance just hits you when the bag opens. That being said, way too many stems in the product. I'm not a tea expert, but I've bought enough and I think they have more stems than the average. I do like the eco-friendly no frill packaging with the zipper though.",Neutral

"I love good teas -- and this is my second disappointment with Stash in the last few weeks.<br /><br />If you brew this as directed the tea leaves a decidedly bitter aftertaste.  I am trying out different lengths of steeping -- I did less than they recommend on the bag, and it didn't have much flavor.  I may try a little longer, or adding more tea leaves per cup.<br /><br />Otherwise, the price is very good, so for someone who is not picky it is a great deal!!!",Neutral
Satisfactory but not completely satisfying as some other tea growers' Assams are but priced reasonably.,Neutral
"It's okay, but I wouldn't buy it again.  My absolute favorite green tea is made by specialteas.com.  It's a decaf apricot green tea.  I always end up going back to that after trying other teas.

"Not sure how much to review here.  They're M&M's with peanuts in them.  They taste like every other M&M with peanuts in them, except they've changed the colors to be 'Halloween colored'.  The fact is, they aren't appropriately named.<br /><br />Halloween colored?  Not a chance.<br />Fall colored?  Maybe.<br />Rotting vegetable colored?  Certainly.<br /><br />Whatever it is, they don't look right no matter what they try to call them.  They actually look like sick versions of the other candies, and are ewww-enough looking that NOT A SINGLE M&M WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE CANDY DISH AT THE COMPANY PARTY.  Even after every other candy dish was cleared out and people are scooping at the bits and pieces at the bottom, nobody was taking the 'Halloween-colored' Peanut M&M's at a Halloween party!<br /><br />I know they're M&M's, so I ate them, but when a crowd of people won't touch a candy product at a Halloween party...you know something's not right there.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Get the regular peanut M&M's...they're more Halloween colored.",Neutral
"I was expecting a coffee like this to have a some flavor, but it is incredibly weak and tastes like gas station coffee with crema.

"Pretty good value compared to buying at the store. I also notice that it doesn't smell as strong (which is good for me), and my dog enjoys them. My medium sized dog chews through about one a day or two days.<br /><br />-update:-<br />I noticed my dog getting loose stool with whitish color for a few days - and thought maybe it might be the rawhide. Stopped giving it to him, and problem solved. So - this product does not sit well with my dog.",Neutral
I have been auto shipping these rawhide's and the first two orders were of great quality. I just received my third order and these rawhides are paper thin. My dog chews the entire bone in about 20 minutes. The quality has totally deteriorated. I'm discontinuing my auto ship. Very disappointing!!,Neutral

"good flavor. nice crunch. not too many broken. but there's only one shape, no crunchy sugar sprinkled on top, and light on butter. tastes more like a coconut cookie...........good cookie, but next time I'll spend a little more for the better ones in tins.",Neutral
"I purchased this item mostly out of curiosity.  I have been hearing about it and people that are on a strict diet trying to lose weight often rave about it.  To me I will never use it as just straight peanut butter on a cracker or bread.  I do believe it is good to put in smoothies, if you want peanut butter in your smoothie.  You can vary the consistency depending on  how much water you use.  For smoothie, you can just add the powder right into your blender.  The taste to me is rather bland.  Sure-obviously it is missing the FAT- but it is lacking in something else as well...just can't put my finger on it...",Neutral
"I think the concept of this item is great. I have only eaten mixed with water and it's just okay. I don't like that sugar has been added since I only use natural PB that needs to be stirred w/ no extra oils etc. I like PB but am not a 'nut' about it. Perhaps this will taste better mixed with other items so I'll try but since I don't eat lots to begin with, it's not a product I'll repurchase.",Neutral
"At first it is not so hot but.... it grows on you.  I added a very tiny amount of honey in warm water to mix, dash of salt too.  like it so much I made up the entire jar like that and kept it ready in refrig .  I put it on apple slices as a pm snack or mid morning break.  Spreads nicely on an apple, unlike real PB.  Love not getting all those calories.",Neutral
"I found the taste to be satisfactory, especially for the reduction in calories.  I didn't mix it right the first time I had to end up making double, which I ate of course.  Ultimately, I decided that I really like crunchy peanut butter the best.  However, my belly will welcome the PB2 just fine.",Neutral
"It's a relatively smaller jar that you get..about comparable to the smaller jars of PB you buy at a grocery store.  I love peanut butter but had cut it out of my diet because of the fat.  This was good when mixed with jelly, jam or honey..you can eat it just like that or spread it on bread/toast.  Yucky when mixed with water to dip fruit...wasn't salty enough and had a funny texture/taste.  Haven't tried it in cooking yet.<br /><br />ON BACK OF JAR ~ 2 Tb serving:  1.5g fat, 94 mg sodium, 5g carb, 2g fiber, 5g protein.  Ingred: roasted peanuts (defatted and powdrd), sugar and salt.<br /><br />Apparently there are other local places where you can get it much more cheaply and without the shipping.  Way too expensive for one jar and the exhorbitant shipping charges.",Neutral
"This review is primarily for the PB2 product (not the chocolate). As an avid PB fan, I wanted to try these, for the obvious caloric advantage over any other PB on the market. The PB2 has a definite ""natural"" PB-product flavor, and can be mixed to lend a similar consistency to peanut butter. That being said, I found it is not as fulfilling when snacked on alone, with a spoon. That being said, I imagine it would make an amazing replacement for real PB in any cooking recipe or blending protein shake. I did enjoy the chocolate flavored PB2 on its own, and would definitely buy it to snack on by itself again. :)",Neutral
"This is a tricky product to review.  On the one hand, the flavor is great! (especially the choc. peanut butter).  If I were rating it on flavor alone, I would give it five stars.  However, I took one star off for the price and another star off for the quantity.  It has 15 servings, with each serving being two Tablespoons.  however, two tablespoons of the powder mixed with a little water only yields about 2 teaspoons of peanut butter.  So if you are making peanut butter for a sandwich or for apples, you go through the jar pretty quick (only took me about two days).  But if you are going to add it to a vanilla protein shake, the one serving adds a ton of flavor.  So I would repurchase this but only for adding to shakes.",Neutral
"Consider buying this from Bell Plantations it's much cheaper, about $3.99 a jar.  Amazon is riping people off with this product, shame on them!",Neutral
"Not good on sandwiches or oatmeal. Good for cooling with.  Don't know if I would buy it again, bit it certainly was interesting.",Neutral
"PB is a major source of calories, so this is a pretty great idea. However, it's honestly just too expensive to purchase as a regular replacement for peanut butter. The taste is just OK: when mixed with water, it tastes vaguely like peanut butter, but it's tough to get a very similar texture. Mixed in protein shakes, though, it's absolutely great. I would buy it exclusively for that purpose if the price were a bit more reasonable.",Neutral
It's a good tasting peanut butter when mixed by a 1:1 ratio with water (sometimes added a bit of Truvia to make it sweeter) but didn't provide nearly as many servings as it says it will. i probably only got 9 out of it.,Neutral
"The pricing is way off.  The description says that it is a savings over the $14.95 retail price, but that is the price of 4 jars at Bell Plantation's website, not just one like on Amazon.  I will be buying this somewhere else.",Neutral
"I was anxious to try this lower calorie version of one of my favorite foods. Overall, texture is fine, but taste is bland and seems to lack depth of real peanut butter. I would use this in recipes, but was sad to say it wasn't my favorite and I would eat regular peanut butter instead.",Neutral
"I really like the taste of this powder.  It is great in a protein shake, especially with 1/2 banana blended in.  My issue is with the shelf life of the product.  A 6.5 oz container lasts a long time, but the container that I purchased from Amazon expired in less than a month from the purchase date.  I noticed that the date of production was exactly a year ago.  Most protein powders have a shelf life of a couple of years.",Neutral
"I Loooove peanut better and this ersatz butter tastes pretty good to me and has 0 cholesterol. Nevertheless, because of its high calorie count and high price, I can stretch the rating to only 3 stars. Yes, the taste is good but, in order to get a 2 tablespoon serving, you need at least 6 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 3 tablespoons of water. Otherwise, 2 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 1 of water will yield only about 1.5 teaspoons of spreadable ""peanut butter""-- Barely enough to coat half a slice of bread. And so...one serving (2 tablespoonsful) of the mixture ends up being 135 calories--not 45 calories which is the count for 2 tablespoons of the powder. If you're counting calories and pennies, you might as well get the regular peanut butter for less than half the price of the dry stuff.",Neutral
"Let's be honest. Nothing will compare to real peanut butter - more specifically, Smuckers All Natural (creamy or crunchy, they both go down smooth). I'll crush a 26oz jar in a week, so obviously I needed a better alternative. Definitely still has a peanuty taste, but... something is missing. I'd still recommend this to anyone who is curious about it. I need to try some of the recipes they have on their website.",Neutral
"I like this product because it is low in calories and it  produces a smooth PB of good quality, if you follow the instructions.<br /><br />However, it is not as tasty as any other peanut butter, especially the commercial ones such as Jiff, Skippy, etc. And it does not satiate you in the same way, since it doesn't have the fat.<br /><br />I happen to like natural PB and this one tends to resemble their taste. I will conyinue to buy it for what it is and despite the price.",Neutral
"This product really deserves 4 or 5 stars for the product itself.  However, as others have noted, Amazon has WAY overpriced it.  The manufacturer has its own website where it is much, much cheaper.",Neutral
"The product gets 5 stars.... Great taste, less fat, easy to throw into smoothies, turn into peanut dressing, for thai food or satay like dishes.<br /><br />Amazon pricing gets 1 star.

"I really wanted to like this product. I really, really did. Having to cut back on fats and sugars, this seemed an ideal product for me. However, I just can't cope with the flavor. Mixing the powder with sugar free jelly produced a water mess that seeped out the sides of my sandwich. Plus, the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the little bit of jelly I threw in, despite using two heaping tablespoons of powder. Using it on its own, mixed with water, produced a consistency that was more what I'm use to encountering with peanut butter, but again the taste was lacking. It tasted like an echo of a slightly burned roasted peanut. I'm sure the product is a great one for what it is, but I just can't see using it as a substitute for non-powdered peanut butter.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because the texture,when mixed with water, has a nice consistency, and it was very finely ground which made it easy to mix. I also think that it would be great for baking...maybe for rolling truffles in to give it a powdery hint-of-peanut coating.",Neutral
"PB2 turned out to be a pretty good alternative to peanut butter. Although its definitely not as sweet it still tastes good on PB and jelly sandwiches and overall I thought it was pretty good. Its no Jiff, but if you are trying to cut back on calories it's a great substitute.",Neutral
"I love peanut butter, and I bought this product in an effort to save some fat, while keeping the protein.  Truthfully, I don't think it's that great on its own... I mixed a little with water to make a peanut-butter-like paste, like it said, and ate it on whole-grain toast.  The flavor just isn't the same as regular peanut butter, and the texture was a little gritty.  For this, I'd rather just use a tablespoon of regular peanut butter - with such a small amount, it isn't much fat anyways.<br /><br />However, the PB2 powder is MUCH better in a protein shake or smoothie because it mixes with the other ingredients and provides that hint of peanut butter flavor.  I think it also might be alright if you made it in to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Either way, it is a great substitute for peanut butter, if you can get past the fact that it doesn't taste exactly the same.  I'm going to try and get used to it!",Neutral
"I was disappointed to discover that once mixed, the tablespoon value of end product required 3 times the quantity to make a sandwich, meaning those label values are multiplied times 3.  I might as well just eat regular peanut butter when I figured up the caloric difference and carbs and sugar.  The taste was good on toast, so I've gone back and given product an extra star for that.",Neutral
"As the title of my review suggests:  I thought this jerky was a little rubbery but had good flavor.  Overall, I would say it's okay.  Worth trying to see if you like it.  I thought the price was fair (I know beef jerky is generally very expensive).",Neutral

"Just changed my star rating from 5 to 3 because of the price.<br /><br />First review:<br /><br />Like so many other people out there, finances have been tight but I have not been able to give up my coffee habit. I've tried many different brands and variates over the past few years and was never pleased until now. Finally a dark roast coffee at an affordable price! With Subscribe and Save, this coffee is the best deal around. It has a nice rich flavor and is strong. I have found that I use less grounds with this coffee than I have with other brands. Yuban dark roast has made this coffee snob very pleased. Both of my cans expire in August 2011 so freshness is not an issue.<br /><br />Second:<br /><br />Wow! Just went to order more and the price has really gone up! The last time I purchased it through subscribe and save it was close to $12 now it is almost $24! I'll be shopping around for a better price on coffee and  probably will get a different brand.",Neutral
"while this is the best coffee i have ever bought, i will not be buying it from this site again. your price is insane...really? i have bought this coffee from amazon before and got 2 33 oz. cans for less than $20 dollars! so why is it so expensive now? i will be shopping elsewhere on the internet for this product. come on amazon....get real with the price.",Neutral
"I wish they hadn't changed the formula for the Yuban that was sold up until about 2 years ago. I even contacted General Foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their ""original"" formula from many years ago. Why? They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isn't what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more.",Neutral
"The Yuban Dark Roast is, I think, an outstanding tasting ground coffee, but is WAY OVERPRICED on the Amazon site.. After I had purchased this in 2010 from Amazon I found it locally at a lower price for the same exact item... It pays to  shop around on some items..",Neutral
Was disappointed when our local stores discontinued this item so ordered it online.  Item came quickly however the expiration date was almost past and the bars reflected the date as they were almost stale tasting.  Too bad since I really liked this item.  Guess the company decided to discontinue the product.,Neutral
"Pros: great price. My friends who are not as serious coffee connoisseurs as I am, seem to like the taste<br />Cons: doesn't taste like a dark roast, tastes more like a light roast. Kind of bitter or fruity for my taste..<br /><br />I recommend Starbucks over this, but you're paying a 50% premium. So maybe this is worth trying out for you",Neutral
"I recieved the product VERY quickly and felt I got a good deal, which was great, but the pill pockets inside the bags are very dry and difficult to work with.

Also, the packaging is actually different than what is pictured, which I expected.",Neutral

"So, the minute I found out that there was something called coconut manna, I couldn't sleep thinking about it!  There is so LITTLE information about it online, as to what ""manna"" truly was that I just had to try it for myself. Well, first what is it?  It's basically mashed up/ground coconut ""meat"". It has the consistancy of peanut butter that has been slightly melted.  It is also a little gritty too.<br /><br />I was under the impression that it was sweet but it's not.  It is as sweet as unsweetened coconut mash would be.  I was misled by other reviewers that said that it was soooo delicious and they eat it straight from the jar.  I wouldn't do that.  It's just plain boring.  BUT...I think it's the kind of product that would work well in a recipe that called for coconut flavor or texture like cookies, cakes, smoothies, and frostings.  But just to repeat, IT IS NOT SWEET LIKE PEANUT BUTTER!<br /><br />I rate it a 5 out of 10. If you have a sweet tooth like me, this is not the product for you.  If you just need an authentic coconut spread, you've got it.  PLEASE NOTE:  It may be too hard to eat at first.  In that case, warm the jar in boiled water for 15 minutes, stir with a butter knife, and let the ""ok"" times roll!",Neutral
"This is a decent product, but I have a lot of texture issues.  The flavor is light and buttery, but not as sweet as I expected.  The sweetness was almost imperceptible.<br /><br />The previous reviews concerning manna were true in that the product does separate.  Re-mixing for was not a problem.<br /><br />The texture issues are that when eating it raw the initially it is smooth and creamy, but soon becomes thick and grainy.  The graininess makes it difficult for me to eat it off a spoon.<br /><br />I have tried mixing it in vegetables and curries and you can still get hints of the graininess.  The product also will solidify after it cools despite using it in cooked a dish.",Neutral
"I was clearly expecting something else. This is not what I was expecting when I ordered this, therefore, I was not impressed with what I got.<br /><br />Sorry I could not be of more help.",Neutral
"I heard about this on Dr. Oz - the ladies who did the taste test really seemed to enjoy it.<br />When I prepared this it smells a bit like weeds or grass, and the taste is not favorable.",Neutral
"I purchased this tea because it was recommended by Dr. Oz. It is supposed to help with bloating, like a diuretic. It does do that, but it has very little taste or color, sort of tastes like dried grass. I recommend putting lemon in it or adding to green tea or breakfast tea.",Neutral
"Reed's make the best ginger brew anywhere, in my opinion. Nice strong ginger ""bite"" and this one has a great fruity flavor as well. My only advice is---Buy directly from Reed's for the best products, DO NOT buy it from Amazon. The batch I received was old, filthy & dusty, with the labels falling off and the tops were bulging and exploding from age. I threw them all away for fear of them being outdated & rotten. Beware.",Neutral

It is white with a little bran left, actually the germ.<br /><br />I think it might be a little better than consuming totally white rice and the taste is fine so I like using it.  However, the price doubled from the last time I got it (not just here, it is hard to find on net and I don't have a lot of asian stores here to look into)<br /><br />It is grown in California and if Calrose, etc, hasn't experienced some price doubling disaster I don't know why this has.<br /><br />But the rice itself is perfectly fine and perhaps a little better than straight white.",Neutral
"Positive: The seller delivered tea which was clearly fresh in date packaged well and quickly. I would not hesitate ordering other teas from this seller.<br />Negative: (for me) However, this was my first time sipping Brodies Scottish tea.  I was disappointed because it was a good bit weaker than I expected from reviews.  The brew was smooth and had an enjoyable taste but, if you are familiar with stronger Scot tea look elsewhere.  The morning blend would be delightful to my palate in the afternoon.  I will keep searching and would love suggestions for a brisk yet smooth morning cup.",Neutral
"For Ramen noodles, this product was middle quality. The price was good, on the first shipment. There are minor QC issues with the packaging, soup base envelope, and other minor quibbles, but, once I was on the 'monthly' delivery, the price was jacked up $9 and then $14 or $16 depending on who did the subtraction...<br /><br />They called the money out of my account well before requested delivery date (and they say that they only 'hold' it, pending shipment... Had they waited 6 hours, it would still have been too damned early, But, I would not have known about it, Until I checked the bank...<br /><br />Well, that process could have caused checks to bounce, and my feeling is, if I say ship no sooner than one date, keep your hands off my account until that date...

And I praised them for their service and care...<br /><br />I hate besmirching them with this go round. In the many calls It took to resolve the issue, the group of 'reps' had a problem with the difference between day of week and date of month, did their best to keep me from talking to a supervisor, a supervisor started talking to someone in their room, one second after the 'hold' music stopped, with the sentence 'he hung up, huh?'...(ooops, forgot the 'click))...<br /><br />I have canceled delivery because a $16 price jump in 28 days, and the service trying to resolve the issue... sounded like the lies the media spreads about many other subjects.

On the recommendation of someone reviewing the Caswell-Massey version, I bought a tin of the talc. This stuff doesn't smell at all like the Lily of the Valley that I know and love. It smells more like Easter Lilies or hyacinths. It is blatant and heady, unlike the Norfolk Lavender version, which was light and lovely. When I use up this tin, I will look elsewhere. I certainly won't buy this again, as it comes close to being the heady kind of perfume that gives me headaches. As talc, it is fine, but the scent is not what I wanted in the least.",Neutral

Sugar is increasingly implicated in many diseases and according to a 60Minutes investigation, is looking like it is a carcinogen.  Isn't it interesting that cancer, obesity, diabetes and other diseases are on the rise at the same time that added sugar is packaged in practically everything we eat.

When I finally got done, the soup was great.  Don't know if I would buy again unless the salt is cut in half (at least).  I am sure the Ministrone must have suffered from the same problem - I don't remember - I do remember my son & I liked it very much - I have been unable to find it at my grocery again, though.

One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.

The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.  I didn't notice this until after I bought and opened the package.  Hopefully, they'll stay fresh for another 2 months.",Neutral
"Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.",Neutral
Ok so my cat loves the flavor will eat them like they are going out of style. HOWEVER these treats are very small and when you have a 17lb large cat he doesn't have to chew them... he just swallows them whole. Therefore they aren't working on the teeth. Fun treat but not going to work for his breath. Will have to find something else.,Neutral
My wife's cats love all the temptation treats.  They will eat these becuase they are gluttons but it is obvious they are not that keen to the taste or the way it makes them feel.<br /><br />I noticed no difference with hairballs using these treats.  If you need something for the hairballs get the brown barley or malt paste.  That stuff works real good and some cats actually like the taste.,Neutral
"Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running.

I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.",Neutral

"Hibiscus is something of an acquired taste, one that I never quite acquired, so for me the best Hibiscus soda is the one that tastes the least like Hibiscus, which in this case means the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VK4D4"">OOBA Hibiscus and Pineapple</a>, followed by the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VK43Y"">OOBA Hibiscus and Orange</a>, followed by the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VIJPO"">OOBA Hibiscus and Kiwi</a>, followed by the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VIJFE"">OOBA Hibiscus and Blackberry</a>, with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VIJA4"">OOBA Hibiscus and Lime</a> coming in last, but I haven't tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VK3TO"">OOBA Hibiscus Original</a> yet.<br /><br />That said I don't find any of the five I've tried undrinkable, and I'd like to try the other flavor eventually.  The biggest problem IMHO is that cutting the sugar makes the somewhat unpleasant Hibiscus flavor stronger than in the original line.  There appear to be no nutritional differences between the various flavors so pick the flavor you like (or think you'll like) the best.<br /><br />I'm not sure that I care that much for the oddly shaped plastic bottles, but with nothing else quite like them out there, they will certainly stand out on store shelves.  People who prefer their soda flavored with sugar rather than corn syrup will be pleased to know that OOBA uses cane sugar, but there isn't any diet version.<br /><br />Note: OOBA has relaunched their entire line; it first came out with 33% more sugar, larger 16 oz. bottles, and a Hibiscus with Vanilla flavor instead of Hibiscus and Kiwi:<br /><br />OOBA Hibiscus with Vanilla, OOBA Hibiscus with Lime, OOBA Hibiscus with Orange, OOBA Hibiscus Original, OOBA Hibiscus with Blackberry, OOBA Hibiscus with Pineapple.",Neutral

"Eight O'Clock French Roast whole bean is a big step above Folgers and other supermarket coffee. But if you like Starbucks or Peets you'll be disappointed. It's nowhere close to the full rich bold flavor and smell (some would say burned but I like it) of these two (and some other local coffeehouses where they roast their own beans).<br /><br />To me, Folgers-type coffees have a thin bitter aftertaste. Eight O'Clock has a bit of that though not bad. However, the beans don't look freshly roasted and don't have a strong aroma when first opening the bag. They look only slightly oily and light brown. Not the dark oily look of fresh Starbucks or Peets beans. I doubled the amount of coffee I usually use to brew and the flavor isn't bad, just not rich and strong.<br /><br />** Update 4/20/10 ** I tried mixing these coffee beans with Starbucks beans. The resulting coffee is a big improvement over Eight O'Clock alone and slightly mellows the Starbucks.<br /><br />** Update 7/2/10 ** I just tried the Italian Dark Roast and found it slightly better, with darker and more oily beans. Perhaps this is due to all four bags being properly vacuum sealed, unlike the French Roast batch I received.",Neutral
"I purchased a 12-oz bag (whole bean) of the french roast based on the several glowing reviews posted here.  After finishing off the bag, I have to say I'm not too impressed.  It's okay, in that I would definitely choose this over any Folgers coffees that I've ever had, but the roast was SO dark that it tasted burnt (I mean completely charred), which masked most of the flavors that might have been there.<br /><br />It's possible that I just got a bad batch -- that happens from time to time.  But honestly, I'm not willing to buy another bag to find out. I've recently started buying from the Roasterie and Atomic Cafe -- with coffee so good, that there's no going back for me. :-)",Neutral
I don't know why this product received so many 5 star reviews.  I would rate this somewhere between Folgers and Rocamojo Coffee (one of the better coffee beans that you can buy on Amazon).  It is about half the price of Rocamojo coffee but it is also twice as expensive as Folgers.  Does it taste 2x better than Folgers? No.  Is it 50% as good as Rocamojo? Yes.,Neutral
"This is a great coffee - love the whole bean freshness. But the pricing was too high. I can buy it cheaper locally in my grocery store (with no tax or shipping).

I'm a lover of the Italian & French roast coffees but this one lacks the boldness of a real French roast. More of a breakfast blend at best. Will not buy again.,Neutral
This coffee lacks the richness I am used to in coffee beans that are french roasted. Although it doesn't make a bad cup of coffee in my book it is not frech roasted.,Neutral
This coffee always tastes good (not bitter) and for a decent price I feel this is the best value coffee available.,Neutral
It's good enough that I would buy it for the coffee pot at work.  I like french roasts and this is a solid cup of coffee.,Neutral
"With the French-roast beans I usually buy, I open the bag and am hit with a strong aroma; inside I are dark and nearing black, shiny beans.  But with this coffee, I get a very faint aroma from slightly more than medium-roasted beans.  The flavor is mellow and slightly acidic.  I was not very impressed; but then, I am highly partial to a dark roast.  Bad batch?  Perhaps.  If you like a dark, robust, French roast, then be wary of Eight O'Clock.",Neutral

"I bought this variety pack so my cats could try the chicken flavors without fish, but they hated it. However, they did like a couple of flavors...so I will order those (if I can remember which ones! argh)<br /><br />My BIG questions/concern: the fine print on the bottom of each can says ""feed one can for every 3 lbs of bodyweight daily""...<br /><br />One of our cats weights 16 lbs (Maine Coon) and the other, 12 lbs, so I will need to feed a total of 9 cans/day. (who can afford that?) This MUST be wrong info?<br /><br />What cat would eat that much food in one day?<br /><br />Makes me question the company. (they also included one flavor that had menadione sodium bisulfate - a known carcinigen - listed on the can, but when I called I was assured they eliminated that from all flavors last year, and that they just haven't ""caught up"" with new labels yet.  hmmmmm.<br /><br />If you are feeding this food, do YOU feed according to the label instructions?<br /><br />I've been feeding/offering 1-2 cans of Fancy Feast Classic/day to my 2 cats, but they never finish it.<br /><br />Why do I need to almost triple that amount of Tiki Cat?  (I do put out high quality (40% protein) kibble 24/7.  A good quality, high protein kibble fills up cats in all the right ways, so one expects them to eat less. My cats only eat 1/2 cup of kibble/day (that's total for both, not each cat!)  Seems way too little, but they maintain their weight just fine on it and the FF. So, I have to wonder about how TikiCat came up with the huge amount needed to feed?<br /><br />I'd love to hear what others do. If cats ""need"" that many cans of TIKI CAT, then each can must be very low on nutrients, as I assume to get the proper nutrients, they need all those cans as per the label?  I hope someone can make sense out of this.  I emailed the company just now as I totally missed that last line until placing an order for Hookena Luau, Hana Luau & Napili Luau. (some of their cans have better (safer) ingredients than others; and those are the more expensive ones & of course those are the ones I will feed IF I find out I don't need to follow the feeding guidelines.....)",Neutral
"I was only recently introduced to energy shots, and before now I have only tried 5-Hour Energy. I was hoping to save a bit of money by buying these instead. Sadly, I have to take two of them to feel anything, and even that does not give me the amount of energy and concentration provided by the more popular brand. I've noted that the energy I do get from these doesn't last very long; about two hours after I take them, my energy levels drops to normal. I've also noticed that they tend to make me feel slightly lightheaded; and a friend that tried one had the same effect.<br /><br />I'll finish off the remainder of my box anyway, because the lightheaded effect isn't bad, but I will not buy these again. They aren't really saving me any money since I have to take two of them, and the fact that the energy doesn't last long is the real deal breaker for me.",Neutral
"Pros:  The taste is fantastic, a sweet berry.  Although I admit I kinda like the acerbic taste of some drinks/shots so that's not that important to me.<br /><br />Cons:  I simply don't get any energy from them.  Admittedly, for my job and as the father of 21 month old I drink more than my fair share of energy drinks.  So if you don't drink a ton, maybe these will be fine for you.  For me though, they simply don't cut it, which is a shame considering the great price.  Compare the back labels of these versus five hr though and these have about half the amount on most ingredients. I might try the red rain extra strength and see if they have more of a kick.  Otherwise its back to Power Horse drinks, also sold here on Amazon, and at a great price.",Neutral
"I picked up a case of these, hoping to find a cheaper alternative to 5-Hour Energy (at less than 1/3 the price, this is definitely cheaper).  Red Rain tastes fine (berry flavor) and provides a similar pick me up that you'd find from 5-Hour Energy, although it seems to last somewhere around 3-4 hours rather than 5-6 like 5-Hour Energy.  Overall, I'd say the price tradeoff is worth it.",Neutral
"I don't use energy shots often but wanted to have some around just in case.  So I've bought a pack of this stuff and two months later the results have usually been hit or miss. Sometimes I feel it, sometimes I forget I've taken it and go about my business.  So I won't be going into details on the performance.<br /><br />The price was great and flavor was good with no strong after taste or anything.<br /><br />My issue with this product is that 90% of the time I open a bottle it, it has brown residue around the rim of the bottle. I see this after peeling off perforated cap band and unscrewing the cap.  I think that if the band were not there the caps would eventually come loose and all of the liquid would spill out.  I do not fear that the bottles have been tampered with but it's a bit unsettling.  Before anyone says it's due to how long I've had it, it's only been two months and I store them in my kitchen cabinets and my desk drawer at work.<br /><br />I believe Red Rain competitors have a small foil seal under the caps which prevent leakage.  Perhaps the lack of this enables them to cut the cost of the product?  At the moment, i will not be buying this item again, if however this issue was corrected I may consider buying Red Rain again.",Neutral

Now, I have had dog food that had a smaller kibble than this stuff has - but he really wanted to eat it so being the dedicated cat person that I am, I smashed a few of them and hand-fed them to him.

I did not pick up on a 'plastic"" taste that other reviewers had.  Rather, I just found the taste rather bland and seemingly watered down.  Who knew that it was from concentrate, and really was watered down!<br /><br />Something to also consider is whether the recent coconut craze will impact deforestation and local ecologies in developing countries where they come from.  It does not seem there are many studies done on this.",Neutral

It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again.",Neutral

Being from a south-asia country where freshly chopped coconut water are available, I was really impressed with the tetra packs that was available from ZICO previously.

The first 2 have a distinct taste but both tastes good the only thing vita coco was 100 percent coco juice while one coco juice was gently pasteurized. The packaging was great you don't need a straw to drink right away. I bought the bottled zico and after my first drink the taste of plastic container was very evident. That was the downfall for me but just tasting it and taking away the plastic taste on my mind it was good but the taste of plastic ruined it.

However, they were quite refreshing and had an interesting mix of ingredients I liked. Next, I gave the chocolate variety a try. Oh, this was much better. It tasted like a less-creamy chocolate milk. Quite good. The calories were somewhat high at 110 per 14-ounce serving. The potassium content was way over the sodium, which was good. It was higher in sugar than I like. The protein and fat content was negligible. So, it's a good drink. Very tasty. But I have a few reservations about it centered around the sugar content and the calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",Neutral
"This product tastes fine.  HOWEVER, at $2.00 per box, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY too expunsive....$1.00, maybe $1.25 tops. ZICO, VOULME, VOLUME, VOLUME!

Had leaking from 4 of 6 containers.  the top caps seems to be weak part that it easily breaks.. amazon did refund the leaky ones.. but I won't order these..again..  Don't want to take another chance on leaks.. although these taste better than the plastic resealable ones at 11oz.,Neutral
"I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.<br /><br />Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut.",Neutral
"I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with ""natural mango flavor"" taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout! I think I can manage to power through the remaining 11 drink boxes I bought, but I won't be wasting my money on this drink again.",Neutral
"First time you taste this (especially with milk), you LOVE this.<br />But it's not something you want everyday.

This can be also achieved by stopping by Starbucks<br />every week or so.",Neutral
"We've loved this brand for a long time, but just purchased some and it was literally riddled with parasitic eggs.<br /><br />We emailed the company at [...] and not one response.

I should never have had to work that hard to get a response or to feel heard, so I cannot give this a full 5 star rating despite finally getting some resolution and usually a good product that isn't totally revolting with things that ought not be there with the fish.  We are afraid to open the other cans we bought now despite coupons en route in case they're just as gross and we spent a lot of money this time.<br /><br />They need to absolutely redo their websites for feedback and I hope they do so soon.",Neutral
First time I tried it.  I don't like the puffed corn as well as the puffed wheat and rice.  It's similar to  Sugar Puffs without all the added sugar and is a whole grain. You probably want to try just one bag and see how well your family likes it before buying such a  large quantity.,Neutral
I was expecting homemade creamy soft banana bread.  I bit it and was a little surprised by the texture.  It almost had a crispy quality to it- like the innards of a Crunch bar.  There were little crisp pieces in every bite!  Not like my homemade recipe AT ALL.  Back to the actual bread part of the banana bread- it was good!  Not the same as homemade- but it was good!  It also had walnut pieces on it- which is great for nut lovers like me!  I prefer pecans on banana bread- but walnuts will do.,Neutral
"I received a free bar in the mail with the Influenster VoxBox program and gave it a try. It really did have the taste of banana nut bread, but the consistency was so so for me.

"Okay, I like banana bread and my family will eat it on occasion, but that's not the case with these.  I received a free sample from Influenster.com and couldn't wait to dig in.  My daughter was the first to grab it, took one bite and passed it to my son.  My son took one bite and passed it to me.  I took one bite and gave it to my husband.  He finished the last bite and said, ""Not my cup of tea..."". Needless to say, we might try something else because we love Quaker products usually.

"The flavor was really good, which is why I gave it 3 stars, however I found the bar to be on the dry side. It's so unfortunate because these would be really great as a breakfast bar or snack bar. It was filling and satisfying! It's packed with nuts and didn't have a faux banana taste. If they can find a way to put some moisture in the bars, I'd purchase them.",Neutral
I would try next time warming them up because it did not taste as good as i thought it would.  But it filled me up and i felt good eating it.,Neutral

"This is pretty good for a bar. I love oats and oatmeal, so I knew I would like this. It's filling and kind of dense, but it doesn't taste like artificial flavors and sweeteners. I think it would be better warmed up, but I didn't think of that before I ate it.",Neutral
"It wasn't the best thing i've ever eaten, but it wasn't the worst either. I did warm it up before I ate it, and it just tasted like warm granola. The banana nut flavor isn't as strong as I'd have liked.",Neutral
"I thought this was just OK, not my favorite Quaker product and I don't know that I would actually buy it.  It does taste like banana bread a bit and it is soft, but it's also crunchy in some places.  Almost like it was overcooked.

"If you like banana bread, then you will love this bar! It's pretty soft and chewy, with lots of flavoring. It is a little too sweet for my liking (but then again I am not a big fan of banana nut anything in general). The nuts don't overpower the bar taste, which is good! The price is a little high but I do think you get what you pay for - especially since it is a very healthy product.",Neutral
"I tried Quaker's Soft Baked Bar in Banana Nut Bread from my Summer Beauty VoxBox by Influenster for breakfast.  I thought it was okay tasting, it wasn't that sweet. It also looked different compared to the official picture. Maybe it was just the one I received that looked like that. The one thing I forgot to do, however, was to warm it up. It probably would have tasted better if I did. It's okay for whenever you're in too much of a hurry to stop for a snack. It's small enough too.",Neutral
okay so this one I did not care for. I HATE packaged banana flavor so this is actually still sitting around with an experation date of Oct 29th.... seems like it can sit for a good while. Not sure how I like that but I'm just weird about food like that.,Neutral

"I didn't love this as much as i had wanted to.

"Basically my title sums it up.  This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now.",Neutral
this freezer tray is not airtight --- so the puree will get freezer burn. I've had to enclose the tray in a plastic freezer bag before storing. I would expect it to work better for the price. However it is very easy to pop-out when ready to defrost.,Neutral

It's also less than half the price, which to me is the most important aspect.  The Beaba trays work fine for their intended purpose but are extremely over-priced.",Neutral
if you freez baby food this is for you!!! very easy to get it out!!!! Gets the job done. Be careful washing it in the dishwasher the plastic top can change its form and after does not cover well.,Neutral
"I like this item because it enables you to freeze baby food in larger portions than ice-cube trays, which is a good thing if your baby is a little pig like mine is.  My biggest complaint is that it is difficult to get the frozen items out of the tray once they are done.  I usually have to run it under hot water for a few minutes, which is not a big deal but just one more step.  Also, the price is very high for what this is.  I could use a second one but at this price I'll make due with the one I've got.",Neutral
"The lid merely sits on the top, and is a huge pain to get on and off, especially since we use this to freeze milk. Half the time it spills everywhere while I'm moving it to the freezer.

Besides, they have too high a percentage of soy, but I was desperate (sigh).",Neutral

"As any chef or foodie worth his Fleur de Sel de Guerande Sea Salt knows, fresh truffles are the only real way to go as far as the whole product. Sure, Urbani oils and some truffle butters are a good substitute if you want that infusion, but as for whole truffles, if you want that real quality - A) you're going to pay for it and B) get it from a company that has a high quality of fresh goods that you know and trust (since fresh truffles will cost you a bundle...white more than black. Also seasonality plays into the truffles (black - harvested usually in autumn and winter and white around October and November). Buying ""fresh"" truffles in May is not usually advised.

If nothing else, write to some famous chef you admire and they can give you a source for the goods if you're lucky ;)<br /><br />The bottom line of this product (or any bottled/not fresh truffle) is this - you get what you pay for...which is to say something substandard for a big price tag.

"Because I found Bonne Maman Cherry Preserves incredibly good, I had no hesitation when it came to purchasing the strawberry.  I can only say I am disappointed by the product and hope my experience may be an aberration.<br /><br />Unlike most of the commercially available products, the flavor of these preserves is excellent.  It is natural and does not taste as if the flavor was enhanced during processing.  However, the consistency of the preserves reminds me of rubber cement - it is gluey and does not spread easily.  Fortunately, I use a lot of preserves on each bagel piece, so this gave me an excuse to pile it on.  I thought it might be that the jar I purchased was getting toward the end of its shelf life, but it still had 15 months until the pull date.  Further, the jar I opened first had whole strawberries through it, rather than smaller pieces.  While this may be considered desirable, I like to be able to apread the preserves and not just glop on chunks of berry.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Cherry Preserves immensely, but I think there are all-natural strawberry preserve products on the market that are better than Bonne Maman Strawberry Preserves.  In fact, one of the big box stores has its own organic strawberry preserves available in a quart jar; these have the same outstanding flavor of the Bonne Maman, but are not rubbery and the strawberries have been crushed rather than processed as whole berries.  I believe the cost is about $7 for that product.",Neutral

"I thought I really got a great deal on these preserves until a week ago when my local Chicago area Italian Cheese store and Green Grocer ran a special on all flavors for $2.00 each. Caputo's, my local store, doesn't usually carry this brand and must have gotten an advantageous buy because $2.00 is an exceptional price.<br /><br />The strawberry is good, spreads easily but is a little runny. A good strawberry taste but my favorite is the raspberry. The labels are easy to remove and then the jars are great to reuse to store leftovers in the fridge.<br /><br />As with most imported jams, jellies and preserves Bonne Maman uses sugar and not high Fructose corn syrup. The label lists sugar and cane sugar so we don't know the specifics.",Neutral
"I first saw this snack item on the tv show ""unwrapped"" and became determined to find them and try them. When I first saw the package I was surprised at how small the packaging was, then when I opened it and popped one into my mouth I understood why.

I put the bag down and went back to it later. on my second attempt I began to feel the same thing. Maybe it was the grease/fat (although it does not appear greasy) from the baked cheese, I'm not sure. Everytime I went to bag after a few bites I got this same feeling in my stomach. I let other people try them and they liked the taste and crunchy texture but I noticed no one finished one of the 0.5 oz bags. Maybe it is my stomach that is sensitive to them that greasy/full feeling was enough to keep me fron ordering them again, but they tasted really good. Maybe I have a sensitive stomach.

"Some people really get into the Just the Cheese snacks, but I think they're just okay.  They *are* crispy and salty, but there's something odd about the texture.  Like a flattened dried chunk of styrofoam.  And they don't taste particularly good, either.  There's no real jalapeno flavor, nor do they taste like cheese.  Sort of a nondescript crunchy thing.  But if you're low-carbing it and jonesing for a crunchy snack to munch on, they're better than diving into a bag of Fritos.  I like the popped cheese better - probably because those are much saltier and crunchier, so they satisfy me with just a couple of bites.

A rep at the company told me they were working to cut the sodium content.  I hope it happens, soon.  I won't buy any more until they do. I like that they are also Gluten-Free.

"I would give these 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. Now that I have tried these I see why there are so many ""mixed"" reviews. To start: they are NOT ""healthy"". Yes, they are low in carbs, but for the total calories from fat (60 out of 75) - the percentage is WAY too high. That means the calories are 80% from fat. Yes, I realize they are made of cheese, which is mostly fat, but they are not something I want to be eating all day every day. (Kind of like the 100-calorie pack treats that are portion controlled, but not so ""healthy"" either.) Plus, they are high in sodium like most other people have pointed out. However, they are very low in carbs (1 gram) and high in protein (5 grams). I got the ""Classic White Cheddar Cheese"". Keep in mind that white cheddar is one of my all-time favorite cheeses. The texture is crunchy - similar to a rice cake (a little denser). The one thing that I strongly DON'T like, is the weird, greasy, oily feeling it leaves on my teeth. But maybe that is just me. But the flavor is fine. The packaging states the following:<br /><br />1 bag (0.5 oz.) - 14 grams:<br /><br />Calories: 75<br />Calories from fat: 60<br />Total fat - 6.5g (10% Daily Value [DV])<br />Cholesterol - 25mg (8% DV)<br />Sodium - 275mg (12% DV)<br />Total carbs - 1g (0% DV)<br />Protein - 5 g<br />Vitamin A - 5% DV<br />Calcium - 16% DV<br /><br />The size of the bag reminds me of those little pouches of fruit gummies that they make for kids lunches.<br /><br />So, all in all, a decent tasting, low carb, high fat snack. Not something I will eat every day, but a nice ""treat"" when I am in the mood for something salty and crunchy.",Neutral
I bought these (for a lot more money) in the health food store. They are a bit strange but if you are on a strict diet and desparate for something crunchy they grow on you. They are quite strong and salty and I would not eat them every day but at least it is a snack I can have on my low glycemic diet.,Neutral
"If you like sharp cheese, this is for you. Unique because made from all cheese, would be great for those with very special food needs! My son didnt like them, but others did. Try! But dont buy too many packs, in case you dont like.",Neutral
"Like many on the Atkins diet, I needed something that I could put in my bag as a snack to keep me from buying any number of high carb snacks.  These cheese mini rounds are crunchy and tasty.  They fill the bill, but only get 3 stars are they are pretty pricey for the very small amount that each bag contains.  And if you are at home, there are a few sliced cheeses that you can microwave yourself and get and even better crunchy cheesey snack.",Neutral
"I got these when I was on the Atkins diet as a snack. They are very cheesy, and very very salty. At first they were delicious , especially after eating low carb for a few weeks. They have a great crunch, and are lightly seasoned. But after 4-5 bags they started to make me nauseous, just to rich and salty. The bags are very small, but since the chips/pucks are so rich I couldn't imagine eating more then whats in each bag in one serving.",Neutral
We ordered this item after a friend recommended them.  They are very tasty but salty.<br />The quality is good but the value just isn't there for my family.,Neutral
At first bite the saltiness hits pretty hard but it kinda grows on you after eating a few. Don't think I'll buy again.,Neutral
"I love that the snacks are good in protein, low carbohydrates, but the amount of sodium is too much.  I hope my letter to the company will help them develop a low sodium product.  In the meantime, I only eat one of the packages every two weeks of less.  I am looking forward to the more healthy product. If you are not concerned about the sodium content, then this is the snack to eat.",Neutral
